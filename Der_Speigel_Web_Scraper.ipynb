            " With the new Matebook X Pro from Huawei, you actually have no choice, you almost have to choose one of the two more expensive versions. The cheapest model in the series, which is not cheap at 1599 euros, is only available in Space Gray. Yes, that's exactly what Apple calls its dark gray. The much cooler and rarer Emerald Green, in which my test device was also delivered, is only available for the 1899 Euro version. Instead of an Intel Core i5, there is also a Core i7 processor and an SSD that is twice as large with a terabyte. Both have 16 gigabytes (GB) of RAM and a Geforce MX250 graphics card. There is therefore sufficient performance and storage space. You can even let go of some games on Huawei's notebook. Just like with complex photo or video editing, the otherwise silent device is then clearly audible. The city building simulation \"Cities Skylines\", for example, demands so much from the processor that the fan has to be turned up to blow the heat out of the aluminum casing. It gets so loud that I prefer to put on headphones. Huawei Matebook X Pro in the test Such a hectic drive of the processor and fan naturally has a dramatic impact on the battery life. Huawei says up to 15 hours, but this value should only be achieved with very modest use: if you do some emails, write down a few words and maybe watch a movie. More demanding tasks make the battery charge for an outlet after half the maximum value. For games like \"Cities Skylines\", the device requires fresh energy after just two and a half hours. This is not unusual for a notebook, you just have to know it. The Matebook X Pro already shows with its screen that it is not a gaming computer. Its 3: 2 format with a resolution of 3000 x 2000 pixels is ideal for working in office programs, while 16: 9 or 16:10 would be better for watching movies. However, the screen impresses on the one hand with its very narrow edge - that just looks good - and on the other hand with its high brightness, which also makes it easy to read on the terrace. A special feature that Huawei has already installed in some notebooks is the unusually placed webcam. Instead of at the top of the screen - as with most mobile computers - it is hidden as a function key between the keys F6 and F7 in the keyboard and opens at the push of a button. Of course, this has the advantage that you can really feel unobserved if you push them away. However, the perspective of the image section taken in this way is not very advantageous, emphasizes the abdomen and upper body and leaves your fingers off if you take notes during a video chat, like greedy snakes dancing through the image. The webcam of the Matebook X Pro: well hidden in the keyboard on the left, extended on the right for breast-to-stomach perspectives. It is not unusual for notebooks to be provided with stickers there. On the far right, too, such a sticker indicates \"Intel Core i7 10th GEN\". But the sticker labeled \"Huawei Share\" next to it is not stupid advertising. It contains an NFC chip through which the notebook can be connected wirelessly to smartphones. Price inquiry time 06/26/2020 11:31 p.m. No guarantee The solution is idiosyncratic, but it works - if only with Huawei smartphones. To connect, hold the smartphone briefly on the sticker, whereupon a window opens on the notebook screen in which the screen of the cell phone can be seen 1: 1. From here, all functions of the smartphone can be controlled with the mouse, apps can be opened and data can be moved. Conversely, you can use the smartphone with this technology to record screen videos from the notebook. Pro Very good screen Good performance Good workmanship Cons High price Only a few interfaces The Matebook X Pro is a computer that is particularly suitable for office work. For Office, the performance is also sufficient for the small model, the 300 Euro surcharge for the top version is particularly worth it if you need the additional storage space and want the cooler color. I never reached the 15 hours of battery life specified in the data sheet in the test, but even with eight hours you get through the workday quite well. Somewhere there is usually an outlet in between. We decide which products we report in the network world and which we test or not. We do not receive any money or other consideration from the manufacturer for any of the test reports. For various reasons, we may not report on products even though we have corresponding test products. We usually get test equipment and review copies of games free of charge for a certain period of time from the manufacturer, sometimes even before the official release. Our test reports can appear in good time or in time for the product's publication.\n",
            "We only test pre-release versions or devices from pre-series production in special cases. We usually wait until we can get test devices or game versions that are identical to the retail versions. In some cases, we also buy products at our own expense if they are already available in stores or online. As a rule, test devices are sent back to the manufacturers after the end of the test. Exceptions are review copies of games and so-called long-term loans: For example, we have game consoles and smartphones in the editorial office, which we can use for long periods. For example, we can report on software updates, new accessories and new games, or make long-term judgments. DER SPIEGEL always bears the costs for trips to events, regardless of whether they take place in Germany or abroad. This also applies if, for example, a company takes over travel planning due to short-term appointments. Events to which we travel at our own expense include the trade fairs Ifa, CES, E3 and Gamescom as well as events from companies such as Apple, Google, Microsoft or Nintendo. At conferences such as the Chaos Communication Congress or re: publica, we usually get free press tickets, like other press representatives, because we report on the conference and are not traditional participants. Since December 2016, some Netzwelt articles have included Amazon ads that contain so-called partner links. If a user visits Amazon via such a link and purchases online there, DER SPIEGEL will participate in the sales in the form of a commission. The ads appear in articles regardless of whether a product test is positive or negative.\n",

            " Within ten days, the Corona Warn app was downloaded by more than 13 million people, a success for the federal government and developers. But the application does not work completely - yet - not everywhere. Above all, an error message should irritate users: contact messages \"may not be supported by 'Corona-Warn' in this region\", says many iPhones. However, the functionality of the app is not affected in these cases, the developers emphasize. Users should confirm the message with \"Ok\", the contact determination then continues to function normally. If you want to make sure that the app is not slowed down, the manufacturers can check the status in the device settings under \"Privacy\", \"Health\" and \"Covid-19 contact log\". The warning is a bug in Apple's iOS operating system. Apple is already working on a solution that is expected to be released to users with the next iOS update. Another error message also affects smartphones with the Android operating system. In some cases, the app reports that the risk assessment has not been updated for more than 24 hours. In these cases, users should ensure that the app runs in the background and can always be updated. In other words, you should start the app once and then not delete it from the memory, as some users do to prevent too many active apps from slowing down the device. The developers of the app also explain that certain energy-saving modes from various smartphone manufacturers that do not adhere to Android specifications could slow down the Corona warning app. Some manufacturers have already published solutions for these cases.\n",

            " As a 17-year-old, Jonty B. pushed a child down from the tenth floor of the Tate Modern Museum in London last summer. A London court has now sentenced him to at least 15 years in prison. B. had pushed the French boy from a museum viewing platform last August. The child survived the 30-meter fall with the most serious injuries. In his admission, the adolescent had stated as a motive that he wanted to appear on the television news. Investigators found that before he did what he did, he searched the Internet for methods of killing someone. The adolescent who was diagnosed with autism as a child was known to be violent. He was looked after in a special facility, but was allowed to leave the house for a few hours. The victim's fear and terror for the parents are hard to imagine, Justice Justice McGowan said. \"You were planning to kill someone that day - and you almost killed the six-year-old boy,\" she said of the video-connected, now 18-year-old B. His act could not be explained by autism. The prosecutor had attested to him a \"feeling cold\", which was not typical for autism, but for a psychopath. He fully understood the consequences of his act and had enough self-control to refrain from it. According to the prosecutor, the youth smiled and laughed after the crime and then said, \"Yes, I'm crazy ... I can't help it. Social services are to blame.\" The child was an accident victim. The now seven-year-old, who was on holiday in England with his parents, hit the terrace on the fifth floor and suffered fractures in the spine, arms and legs, and brain hemorrhage. At the time of the fact, thousands of visitors were in the Tate Modern. It is one of the largest museums of contemporary art in the world. The museum is housed in a former power station on the Thames.\n",

            " This article will be updated continuously. Don't miss anything: Subscribe to our Coronavirus newsletter for the latest developments and key background information. 10 p.m .: After the corona outbreak at meat producer Tönnies and the expansion of free tests, there are hardly any signs in the Gütersloh district of a transmission of the virus to the population. The circle announced. From June 19 to 25, 55 cases unrelated to the Tönnies parent plant in Rheda-Wiedenbrück had become known. On Thursday, 14 cases were added, it said in a press release. In tests in a vocational college, one of a total of six test centers, 2937 people were examined for Corona, nine were tested positive. 8:40 pm: US President Donald Trump's virologist and advisor, Anthony Fauci, has been concerned about the rapid rise in corona infections in many states. \"We have a serious problem in certain areas,\" said Fauci at a press conference by the US government's Coronavirus Task Force. \"We can only get through this together.\" A number of states are currently experiencing the highest infection rates since the onset of the corona crisis. Countries in the south of the country such as Florida, Texas and Arizona, but also in the west such as California are particularly affected. Due to the skyrocketing infections, Texas ordered bars to be closed on Friday. Florida banned alcohol from bars. With around 40,000 reported cases, the number of new corona infections in the United States reached a new high on Thursday. Vice President Mike Pence - who heads the task force - said: \"We lost more than 126,000 of our countrymen to the disease.\" He expressed his sympathy to the relatives of the victims. \"We have made really remarkable progress,\" said Pence. The number of confirmed new infections increases, especially in southern states. The number of fatalities is falling nationwide. The Corona Virus Task Force held a press conference on Friday for the first time in two months. Critics accuse US President Donald Trump of no longer paying due attention to the crisis. Trump has been pushing for a quick return to normality for weeks to get the economy going again in election year 2020. 8:20 p.m .: Pope Francis has given 35 ventilators to countries that are badly affected by the corona pandemic. Many of the gifted countries are in Latin America, as the Vatican said. The Pope, who was born in Argentina, wanted to express his closeness to the countries, especially those whose health systems were having difficulty coping with the crisis, the statement said. The recipients in Latin America include Brazil, Venezuela and Mexico. Francis also donated devices to Cameroon and Zimbabwe in Africa and to Bangladesh in South Asia. Before that, Francis had already provided money for people in special need through an aid fund. This is there for everyone who needs support so that they can \"stand on their own two feet again\", wrote the Pope. 8:10 pm: The owners of the New York bar \"Stonewall Inn\" have got into financial difficulties due to the three-month lockdown. This reported the Reuters news agency. The historic meeting point for the gay, lesbian, transsexual and queer scene in the Greenwich Village district therefore needs around $ 100,000 to stay afloat. With a donation campaign, almost a third of the sum had already been raised. For the \"Stonewall Inn\", Sunday is also an important day for the entire LGBTQ scene. The night of June 28, 1969, the so-called Stonewall Uprising broke out at the bar on Christopher Street, a series of clashes between members of the scene and the police. People around the world commemorate the riots on Christopher Street Day and campaign for the rights of the LGBTQ communities. 7:50 p.m .: Despite the continuously increasing corona numbers, the Brazilian football association CBF and those responsible for the first and second division clubs are planning to resume the Brazilian championship for 8 and 9 August. This is clear from a statement by the CBF. Accordingly, CBF President Rogério Caboclo had proposed the dates, almost all clubs agreed. The association had suspended all national competitions until mid-March until further notice. The readmission - without an audience - still depends on the approval of the health authorities. But 19 of the 20 first division clubs have agreed to play in other locations where sporting events are allowed if they are not approved in their cities. 19:38: Despite record numbers of new corona infections in the United States, US Vice President Mike Pence sees success in the fight against the virus. \"We have made really remarkable progress,\" said Pence at the first briefing by the White House Coronavirus Task Force in almost two months. The number of confirmed new infections increases, especially in southern states. The number of fatalities is falling nationwide. The situation is therefore significantly better than two months ago. Pence attributed the increasing number of confirmed new infections, among other things, to the extension of the tests - similar arguments US President Donald Trump. With around 40,000 reported cases, the number of new corona infections in the United States reached a new high on Thursday. Pence, who heads the task force, said: \"We have lost more than 126,000 of our countrymen to the disease.\" He expressed his sympathy to the relatives of the victims. 7:24 pm: After series tests in a turkey slaughterhouse in Wildeshausen in the Lower Saxony district of Oldenburg, a quarantine of two weeks has been ordered for all around 1,100 employees and their contact persons. The district announced. \"The primary task is to protect the population from further infections,\" said District Administrator Carsten Harings. Overall, there are 46 positive cases of Covid-19 infection in the slaughterhouse based on 1183 test results. The Geestland turkey specialties slaughterhouse in Wildeshausen is now gradually shutting down operations and will be closed for two weeks. 6.41 p.m .: Travelers from a district with a high rate of corona infections will apparently only be able to be accommodated in a hotel in the future if a medical certificate confirms that they have no infection. This is said to come from a decision by the head of the Federal Chancellery and the head of the state and senate chancelleries of the federal states, from which the dpa news agency quotes. The required medical certificate must \"be based on a molecular biological test that was carried out at most 48 hours before arrival\". North Rhine-Westphalia's Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) welcomed the agreement. After the Corona outbreak in the Westphalian district of Gütersloh at the meat producer Tönnies, most of the federal states had decided to restrict travel for people from corona hotspots. Laschet said: \"The insecurity and stigmatization of travelers from Gütersloh in the past few days must not be repeated. We can only defeat Corona together, not against each other.\" 6:20 p.m .: After panic buying due to a new outbreak of coronavirus in Australia's second largest city Melbourne, supermarkets have rationed the sale of toilet paper again. The two largest chains, Woolworths and Coles, announced that customers across the country, as at the beginning of the pandemic, would only be able to buy a limited number of toilet and kitchen paper. Prime Minister Scott Morrison called on his compatriots to immediately stop buying hamsters. The authorities had previously reported 30 new infections within 24 hours. Despite the low levels of infection, fear of a second wave of corona is growing, while most Australian states are lifting restrictions more and more. According to official data, Australia has so far had more than 7,500 cases of infection, 104 people died from the consequences of the virus disease. 5.50 p.m .: Turkey is pressing for a quick lifting of the German travel warning. However, according to SPIEGEL information, the federal government is afraid that holidaymakers who are suspected to have corona will be compulsorily treated with a controversial malaria drug. 5.40 p.m .: NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) defended the lockdown for the Gütersloh and Warendorf districts. Laschet told the \"Westfälische Nachrichten\" (Saturday) that \"it had been carefully considered whether individual cities could be taken out of the rules, for which there are many good reasons.\" The state agreement with the federal government and the Robert Koch Institute deliberately provided rules for the entire district. \"For the future, you might have to think about new mechanisms,\" said Laschet. The reason for the lockdown is the massive coronavirus outbreak at the Tönnies slaughterhouse in Rheda-Wiedenbrück. In the districts of Warendorf and Gütersloh, there is a lack of understanding in many municipalities that in view of the very low number of infections, all municipalities with a total of around 600,000 inhabitants had to go through the lockdown - even if they are very far from the slaughterhouse. So far, the pandemic plan only provides for the lockdown for entire districts or large cities, not for smaller areas. Laschet held out the prospect that increased test capacities might provide a \"new basis for decision-making\" in the coming week. 5.20pm: Due to the rapid increase in coronavirus infections, the US state of Texas is closing the bars again. Governor Greg Abbott said on Friday that the new infections were mainly due to \"certain activities\", including \"the gathering of Texans in bars\". Abbott therefore issued a decree that bars are no longer allowed to receive guests and are only allowed to sell drinks to take away. Restaurants are only allowed to work with a visitor capacity of 50 percent. Texas, like a number of other US states, is currently experiencing the highest number of coronavirus infections since the crisis began. On Thursday, Texas reported nearly 6,000 new cases within 24 hours, more than ever before. The United States reported a record number of new infections within a day. 5:00 p.m .: As the pandemic progresses, doctors understand better and better what the novel coronavirus Sars-CoV-2 can do to the body. It is now clear that the pathogen not only attacks the lungs, but also the heart, brain, kidneys and blood vessels. Now doctors in a letter to the journal New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) report that Covid-19 could possibly trigger diabetes. Scientists often use this route to alert colleagues to suspicions. 4.45 p.m .: The virus reveals what we have suppressed too often, all the background to the scandal at Tönnies and the latest research results on Sars-CoV-2: Here is the weekly overview by Kurt Stukenberg, Deputy Head of Science at 4.30 p.m .: Around the world According to the World Health Organization (WHO), it will take around $ 31 billion by the end of 2021 to be able to quickly provide tests, vaccinations and medicine in the corona crisis. Experts in a fund under the umbrella of the WHO announced in Geneva on Friday that $ 18 billion would be needed for the development of vaccines alone. So far, only a fraction of the necessary money has been promised by the international community. \"The investment required is significant, but it pales in comparison to the cost of Covid-19,\" the fund said from governments, foundations, and the private sector. One of the strategic goals is to make 500 million tests available to middle and low-income countries by mid-2021. Healthcare workers from around 50 countries need to be trained. In addition, two billion vaccine doses should be available by the end of 2021, half of which are also intended for people in poorer countries. \"We have to invest in vaccine production in advance,\" said WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan. More than 200 vaccine candidates worldwide are being tested, around 15 of which have already been tested on humans. Read more about the fight for the saving corona vaccine here. 4.15 p.m .: According to the district government, the outbreak of coronavirus in the Tönnies plant in Rheda-Wiedenbrück has so far been limited to employees living in the neighboring district of Warendorf. This was confirmed by the test results so far, a spokesman said on Friday in Münster. During the night, the Robert Koch Institute published figures on the number of new infections per 100,000 inhabitants within the past seven days in the Warendorf district. At 47.9, this mark had fallen below the decisive value of 50. On Thursday, this was still at 50.4. According to figures from the district government (as of Friday, 12.30 p.m.), 218 people in the Warendorf district - in the vicinity of the Gütersloh district with its Tönnies headquarters - are currently infected with corona (previous day 217), 723 people were counted throughout the corona crisis, 485 are considered to be recover. The district of Warendorf has around 280,000 inhabitants. 4:00 p.m .: The police cordoned off several buildings in the southern Italian city of Mondragone because the coronavirus is spreading among Bulgarian harvest workers. However, some harvest workers refused to stay in the restricted area because they wanted to continue working. There were protests by Italian residents, as the broadcaster RAI reported. At night, according to reports from the Ansa news agency, a car that was allegedly owned by a Bulgarian was set on fire. Four positive Bulgarians who had left the zone were found. 43 people are infected in the city about 50 kilometers northwest of Naples, the broadcaster RAI reported on Friday. In another case, more than 60 employees of a large delivery company in Bologna were infected with the corona virus. Restricted area: At least 43 people tested positive in Mondragone CIRO DE LUCA / REUTERS There is criticism in Italy regarding the placement of the harvest workers. The Bulgarians \"live in illegally occupied buildings and are among the countless workers who are employed on the farms in the south without rights,\" wrote anti-mafia author Roberto Saviano in the newspaper \"La Repubblica\". Italy's Minister of Health Roberto Speranza also emphasized the outbreak in Bologna: \"The small outbreaks that have been reported in the past few hours show us that the battle has not been won and that we have to be careful in the coming weeks.\" In Italy, there have been almost 240,000 infections and almost 35,000 deaths related to the virus since the end of February. 3.30 p.m .: The risk of dying from an infection with the coronavirus is very low in children and adolescents. In the vast majority of those infected, Covid-19 takes a mild course, as confirmed by a large Europe-wide study. Most developed fever and upper respiratory complaints. 3.10 p.m .: The Federal Government is charging the 67,000 tourists who have been brought back from abroad because of the coronavirus pandemic 200 to 1000 euros for the flights. This is intended to cover 40 percent of the total cost of the unprecedented campaign of 94 million euros. The cost sharing of the stranded is staggered: for flights from the Canary Islands and North Africa 200 euros have to be paid, for southern Africa and the Caribbean 500 euros are due, returnees from South America and Asia have to pay 600 euros, and whoever is brought back from New Zealand and Australia receives an invoice for 1000 euros. The Federal Foreign Office announced these prices on Friday after sending the first 1,000 invoices. The Federal Foreign Office launched the campaign on March 17, together with tour operators and airlines, after many countries had temporarily closed borders and cut flight connections due to the coronavirus pandemic. A total of around 240,000 travelers were brought back. The tour operators brought back the tourists who had booked with them free of charge. For individual tourists and other travelers, the Federal Foreign Office itself chartered machines that completed 260 flights and brought back around 67,000 people from around 65 countries. These people are now asked to checkout. The ticket prices are roughly in the range of cheap economy tickets for the respective regions. Among the 67,000 passengers are about 56,000 German citizens, 7600 people from other EU countries and 3650 people from countries outside the European Union. 3 p.m .: Angela Merkel (CDU) reported on Friday to the district administrator of the district of Gütersloh, Sven-Georg Adenauer. \"The Chancellor gave me courage and thanked me,\" said the CDU politician, according to a press release from the North Rhine-Westphalian district. The citizens of the district came into the current situation through no fault of their own, the Chancellor told him on the phone. Due to the lockdown and the associated restrictions, they made a very important contribution so that the virus could not spread beyond the Gütersloh district. \"The Chancellor would like to thank the population and everyone who works to tackle this crisis,\" said Adenauer. 2.45 p.m .: Bundesliga promoted Arminia Bielefeld will end the partnership with the meat company Tönnies after the big Corona outbreak there. The club confirmed this on request. Arminia had previously informed the \"Neue Westfälische\" that the advertising contract with the company expired at the end of the season. 2.30 p.m .: The World Health Organization (WHO) has so far not received an official letter from the United States to end cooperation. The decision was announced, but a formal letter had not yet arrived, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Friday at a video session with a body of the Council of Europe. He said Washington's planned move was unfortunate. Tedros said it would be better, if any, if the United States waited for an independent evaluation of the WHO response to the coronavirus pandemic. Washington could give its opinion on the work of the organization and participate in reforms in the evaluation. The WHO had come under strong pressure from the United States in the corona crisis. US President Donald Trump accused her of informing about the danger too late and of being influenced by China. The United States has recently ended its collaboration with WHO and plans to put its contributions into other global health projects. Tedros emphasized that the WHO raised the alarm early. In retrospect, this could be assessed by independent studies. 2:05 p.m .: Citizens of the district of Gütersloh in North Rhine-Westphalia have been able to have their corona virus tested for free in a drive-in since Thursday evening. The drivers at Gütersloh Airport steer their vehicles in four lanes through a disused helicopter hangar. The tests are taken contactlessly by several teams in the shift system. The circle is supported by soldiers from the Bundeswehr. This was indicated by the district in a press release on Friday. A large corona outbreak had occurred in a factory of the meat processor Tönnies in the district of Gütersloh. The district has now set up capacities for 10,000 tests a day in six centers. Resident general practitioners with health insurance approval also take the free tests in their practices. Since Wednesday, long lines of people have been forming in front of the centers in the districts of Warendorf and Gütersloh who wanted to take a corona test in order to be sure of an upcoming vacation with a negative result. Some holiday regions prohibit overnight stays without this proof. Corona smears in the helicopter hangar Guido Kirchner / dpa 1:50 p.m .: After the recent coronavirus outbreak in the Gütersloh area, the German District Council praised the work of the authorities in the affected Gütersloh and Warendorf districts. The two districts have done exemplary work in the past few days, expanded their capacities in the health offices and in this way managed the situation very confidently, the president of the German district council, Reinhard Sager, quoted in a message from Friday. At the same time, the district council warned against stigmatizing people from the affected areas. \"We will have to get used to the fact that, depending on the regional outbreak, limited action may be required in certain areas or facilities,\" said Sager. Such measures would become the norm in the current phase of the pandemic in the coming months. 1.35 p.m .: Brandenburg has also decided to ban people from Corona risk areas. According to information from the German Press Agency, the cabinet agreed on Friday to prohibit accommodation for people from areas with more than 50 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants within a week. The RBB had previously reported about it. After a corona outbreak at the meat processor Tönnies in the district of Gütersloh, several federal states had decided to ban accommodation for guests from certain risk areas. 1:10 p.m .: Russia has reported fewer than 7,000 new infections for the first time since the end of April. According to the health authorities, the number of confirmed infections with the new coronavirus rose by 6800 to 620,794 within 24 hours. The number of deaths rose by 176 to 8781. The Johns Hopkins University in the United States counted among 620,000 coronavirus cases for Russia. Russia has the third most infections worldwide after the United States and Brazil. 12.45 p.m .: In mid-May, at least 260 employees at Westfleisch in Coesfeld tested positive for the corona virus. A new outbreak is now to be prevented: The company has announced that it will start daily corona tests of around 5000 production and production-related employees in the course of the coming week. These employees have been tested weekly for a month. The aim of the higher clock sequence is to identify infected people more quickly and to interrupt infection chains at an early stage. 12.40 p.m .: The Swedish fashion chain Hennes & Mauritz suffered a significant drop in the second business quarter due to the corona crisis. The second quarter of the fiscal year began in early March and ran until the end of May, spanning the previous heyday of the corona crisis in Europe. In the reporting period, the after-tax loss amounted to the equivalent of 470 million euros, as the group announced on Friday in Stockholm. In the same quarter of the previous year, H&M had made a profit of 430 million euros. 12.30 p.m .: Diplomatic relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates do not exist - but in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, both countries now want to join forces. Companies in both countries have agreed to cooperate in research and development to combat the corona virus, the governments of both countries said on Thursday. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the cooperation was a result of \"longer and more intensive contacts\" with the Arab state. Cross-border cooperation will improve safe healthcare across the region, said Netanyahu: \"The stronger we are, the more powerful we are in warding off our enemies and bringing our friends closer.\" According to the United Arab Emirates state news agency, WAM, a total of four companies signed the cooperation agreement. Given the global spread of the corona virus, it is \"essential to put human protection at the forefront of global action to overcome this unprecedented crisis.\" It was initially unclear which companies were involved in the cooperation. No further details of the collaboration have been released. 12:10 p.m .: British Health Minister Matt Hancock has threatened to close beaches due to non-compliance with corona regulations. \"The last thing that people want is for the virus to come back,\" Hancock told TalkRadio. The regulations on social distancing would have to be observed and a second wave of pandemics prevented. If the number of cases increases again, then the government will act. \"We cannot go backwards,\" said Hancock: \"We have to stop this disease.\" On Thursday there were large crowds of people on the south coast in sunshine, distance was hardly kept. The seaside resort of Bournemouth, which is popular for its wide beach and Victorian architecture, was particularly affected. Despite the risk of infection with the corona virus, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had already allowed day trips to England weeks ago and had met with criticism. There, the authorities triggered a warning level because the situation was no longer manageable. This gives the emergency services more rights and coordination options. The police and local residents also complained about garbage pollution, aggressive behavior by beach visitors and alcohol abuse. Many visitors traveled from London and even Birmingham and had to wait up to two hours shortly before Bournemouth to get into the city with their cars. The trains were also overcrowded. Law enforcement officers and city officials said they were spit on during beach operations. It was the hottest day of the year in the country so far. Visitors to the beach at Bournemouth on Thursday: No gap Finnbarr Webster / Getty Images 11:20 a.m .: In the North Rhine-Westphalian district of Warendorf, the number of new coronavirus infections per 100,000 inhabitants has dropped below the critical mark of 50 within the past seven days. This is clear from the figures published by the Robert Koch Institute on Friday. According to this, there are now 47.9 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants in the district of Warendorf in the past seven days. Previously, the value was 50.4. Also in the district of Gütersloh, where a regional lockdown applies to the meat producer Tönnies after the coronavirus outbreak, the figure continues to fall after extremely high values. With 177.7 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in the past seven days (previously 192.8), the value is still significantly above the 50 mark. On Tuesday, the value was still 270.2 according to the NRW Ministry of Health. 10.55 a.m .: Saarland has decided to prohibit accommodation for travelers from coronavirus risk areas. As of Monday, no more guests will be accommodated nationwide who come from a district with more than 50 infected people per 100,000 inhabitants, the government spokesman said on Friday night. The decision was made at a special meeting of the Saarland Ministerial Council on Thursday evening. The new regulation will come into force on June 29. Several other federal states had imposed restrictions on travelers from corona hotspots in the past few days, the background to the debate was the recent outbreak of corona virus in the Gütersloh area. The Saarland Prime Minister Tobias Hans (CDU) advocates a \"nationwide uniform procedure\" when dealing with travelers from counties with high infection rates. On Wednesday, he therefore turned to the chairman of the prime ministerial conference, Bavaria's head of government Markus Söder (CSU). A \"patchwork of different regulations\" must be avoided, says Hans. 10.40 a.m .: The Corona crisis also hit the French-Dutch airline Air France-KLM hard. Paris and The Hague have now agreed on an aid package. 10.35 a.m .: Sweden's state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell has reacted with incomprehension to the classification of Sweden as a special risk country by the WHO. \"Unfortunately, this is a total misinterpretation of the data,\" Tegnell told SVT. Sweden has increasing numbers of cases, but based on the fact that the country is carrying out significantly more tests than before, said Tegnell. \"It is unfortunate to mix Sweden with countries that have had no problems before and are apparently only at the beginning of their epidemic.\" The WHO should probably just have reported to Stockholm, then it could have been given a more detailed picture of the Swedish situation, Tegnell said. The head of the WHO Regional Office for Europe, Hans Kluge, spoke on Thursday of rising corona numbers in Europe. 30 countries in the European region have reported increasing case numbers over the past two weeks, the WHO Regional Director said at his weekly online press conference in Copenhagen. In eleven countries, an accelerated transmission rate has led to a very significant resurgence of the corona virus - including, in addition to Sweden, countries such as Armenia, Azerbaijan, Albania and Ukraine. In these countries, there is a threat to the health care system if the spread is not dealt with decisively, said Kluge. 10:10 am: Despite the risk of infection by the corona virus, thousands of Liverpool FC fans have celebrated the club's first football championship in 30 years in front of the stadium on Anfield. After Chelsea made Jürgen Klopp's team 2-1 against Manchester City champions, many fans gathered at the stadium, celebrating, singing and burning fireworks. Distance rules and hygiene measures were hardly observed. The Guardian reported that many fans wore face masks. Photos of the celebrations also showed some fans without masks. Rob Carden, deputy chief of the County Merseyside, was critical of the ceremony. The region had previously been \"disproportionately affected by the coronavirus pandemic,\" said Carden, the Guardian said. This would give people the responsibility to prevent further cases. \"Unfortunately, as we have seen throughout the lockdown, not everyone has followed the regulations,\" said Carden. \"Although the vast majority of the celebrations made a good impression, a large number of people chose to do so gather outside the stadium \". Jürgen Klopp had warned of parties on the streets. \"I hope you stay at home. Go outside your house and party if you want to, but nothing more,\" said the Liverpool manager. In the past few months, Liverpool's Champions League game against Atlético Madrid with around 52,000 spectators had been considered a so-called superspreader. 9:25 a.m .: It gets crowded on the beaches: the summer holidays have started in Hamburg, Berlin, Brandenburg and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia will follow early this week. Because of the corona crisis, more Germans are going on vacation in their own country than usual this year. The holiday resorts on the North and Baltic Seas also notice this. They consistently report a very good booking situation. \"With us, the quarters are almost fully booked. The pre-bookings for summer 2020 were already very good even before the corona pandemic, so that only a few short-term travelers were added,\" said the spokeswoman for Tourism Service Grömitz, Jaqueline Felsmann. The beds on the North Sea coast are also largely booked. \"We have probably had the strongest June in recent years, and in the coming week we will leave the 90 percent mark in occupancy and occupancy behind,\" said Olaf Raffel from Büsumer Tourismus Marketing Service TMS. In order to avoid too much crowding on the beaches, the Baltic Sea resorts of Scharbeutz, Sierksdorf, Neustadt, Pelzerhaken and Rettin have developed a website where day tourists can find out in advance about the space available on the beaches. The system will be available by mid-July at the latest, said André Rosinski, Managing Director of the Lübeck Bay Tourism Agency (TALB). 9:15 am: Mecklenburg-West Pomerania's Prime Minister is looking forward to tourists during the summer holidays. Here she explains which guests are not welcome in her state. 8:15 a.m .: Despite the ongoing corona crisis, the hot phase of the season preparation is scheduled to start in the NFL football professional league on 28 July As league vice president Jeff Pash confirmed in a media round on Thursday evening, the teams can start their training camps from this date. With special permission, rookies and other selected players can complete the first practice sessions even earlier. The NFL currently has its scheduled start of the season under strict hygiene and safety protocols on September 10th. The games should take place quite normally in the home stadiums of the individual teams; the number of spectators allowed should vary from state to state according to the regulations according to the portal \"The Athletic\". Training camp in the NFL (archive picture) David J. Phillip / AP 7:35 a.m .: The industry talk for livestock husbandry and meat industry at Federal Minister of Agriculture Julia Klöckner (CDU) scheduled for Friday has already triggered massive criticism in advance. Der DGB und die Grünen sprachen von einer bloßen \"Show\"-Veranstaltung. Das Treffen war nach der Serie von Coronavirus-Ausbrüchen unter Mitarbeitern von Schlachthöfen anberaumt worden. Das Vorstandsmitglied des Deutschen Gewerkschaftsbundes, Anja Piel, monierte, dass erst \"auf Nachhaken\" und \"in letzter Minute\" Vertreter der Beschäftigten eingeladen worden seien. Offenbar solle eine nachhaltige Verbesserung der Arbeitsbedingungen der Beschäftigten der Fleischbranche nicht im Vordergrund stehen, sagte Piel der \"Neuen Osnabrücker Zeitung\" (\"NOZ\"). Kritiker führen die Ausbreitung des neuartigen Coronavirus in der Branche auf die Arbeitsbedingungen sowie die Unterbringung vieler Beschäftigter in beengten Gemeinschaftsunterkünften zurück. Many Eastern Europeans work in the slaughterhouses, which are employed by subcontractors. 07:30 Uhr: Festivals fallen aus, Campingplätze in Deutschland sind sehr gefragt: Das Gelände des \"Melt!\" und des \"Splash\"-Festivals wird in diesem Jahr wegen der Coronakrise zum Pop-up-Campingplatz. Damit sollen auch Teile des ausgefallenen Festivalgeschäfts kompensiert werden, teilte Ferropolis-Geschäftsführer Thies Schröder mit. Normalerweise zieht es Zehntausende Musikfans zu den Festivals auf dem Veranstaltungsgelände Ferropolis bei Gräfenhainichen in Sachsen-Anhalt. 06.15 Uhr: Fast 40.000 Menschen sind laut mehreren Erhebungen binnen 24 Stunden in den USA positiv auf das Coronavirus getestet worden - so viele wie noch nie. Lesen Sie hier mehr dazu. 05.50 Uhr: Nordrhein-Westfalens Ministerpräsident Armin Laschet lässt die Haftbarkeit des Fleischproduzenten Clemens Tönnies für den Corona-Ausbruch im Kreis Gütersloh prüfen. Zur Frage, ob das Unternehmen haftbar zu machen ist, sagte Laschet dem Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland: \"Es wird derzeit sehr genau geprüft, ob und gegen welche Regeln das Unternehmen verstoßen hat und wo es in Haftung genommen werden kann.\" Laschet betonte, er sehe Tönnies in der Verantwortung. Der Ministerpräsident verteidigte seine Regierung gegen die Kritik, zu spät gegen die Arbeitsweise der Fleischfirma vorgegangen zu sein. Laschet war selbst in die Kritik geraten, weil er gesagt hatte, der Corona-Ausbruch im Tönnies-Schlachthof sei auf die Einreise von osteuropäischen Arbeitern zurückzuführen. Darüber hatte sich Außenminister Heiko Maas (SPD) empört. Nach Ansicht von Bundesarbeitsminister Hubertus Heil (SPD) wird der Fleischkonzern für Schäden durch den Vorfall haften müssen. Grünenfraktionschef Anton Hofreiter hatte an Tönnies appelliert, die entstandenen Kosten aus seinem Privatvermögen zu bestreiten. In einem Schlachtbetrieb wurden in den vergangenen Tagen mehr als 1500 Menschen positiv auf das Virus getestet. In the Gütersloh district, which was badly hit by the outbreak, numerous people have already had themselves tested voluntarily. Die Ergebnisse spendeten etwas Hoffnung, da es den Tests zufolge bislang nur wenige Infizierte in der Bevölkerung gibt. Das Land NRW hat für die beiden betroffenen Kreise Gütersloh und Warendorf das Alltagsleben vorläufig bis zum 30. Juni wieder deutlich eingeschränkt. 05.15 Uhr: Das Helmholtz-Zentrum für Infektionsforschung (HZI) will eine bundesweite Corona-Antikörperstudie im Kreis Reutlingen starten. Von Mittwoch an sollen innerhalb eines Monats 2500 Einwohner nach dem Zufallsprinzip ausgewählt und zu Tests eingeladen werden. \"Wir wollen sehen, wie schnell sich die sogenannte Durchseuchung der Gesellschaft entwickelt\", sagte Studienleiter Gérard Krause. Antibodies in the blood are considered to be evidence of a recent infection. Eine zweite Testreihe soll im Herbst oder Winter erfolgen. Genauso wie im Kreis Reutlingen will das HZI in rund acht weiteren deutschen Kommunen vorgehen. The different test locations and test times are intended to enable the results to be reliably transferred to the entire federal population. Neben Alter und Geschlecht sollen beispielsweise auch Berufsgruppen abgefragt werden. Bei den Tests wird das Blut der Teilnehmer auf Antikörper gegen Sars-CoV-2 untersucht, die bisherigen wissenschaftlichen Erkenntnissen zufolge eine Immunität bewirken. Viele Infektionen verlaufen so mild, dass sie nicht erkannt werden. Das Wissen um die tatsächliche Verbreitung des Virus könnte eine wichtige Entscheidungsgrundlage im künftigen Umgang mit der Pandemie sein. Auch das Robert Koch-Institut ist dabei, Antikörpertests in größerem Maßstab in mehreren Kommunen durchzuführen. 05.05 Uhr: Die lokalen Behörden haben dem Robert Koch-Institut 477 Corona-Infektionen binnen eines Tages gemeldet. Damit haben sich seit Beginn der Coronakrise 192.556 Menschen in Deutschland nachweislich mit Sars-CoV-2 angesteckt, wie das RKI am frühen Freitagmorgen meldete (Datenstand 26.06., 0.00 Uhr). According to RKI, 8,948 people infected with the virus died in Germany - an increase of 21 compared to the previous day. Etwa 177.100 Menschen haben die Erkrankung überstanden. That is 300 more than the day before. Die Reproduktionszahl, kurz R-Wert, lag nach RKI-Schätzungen mit Datenstand 25.6., 0.00 Uhr, bei 0,59 (Vortag: 0,72). This means that an infected person infects less than another person on average. The R value shows the infection process approximately one and a half weeks beforehand. Since mid-May, the RKI has also been issuing a so-called seven-day R. It refers to a longer period and is therefore less subject to daily fluctuations. Dieser Wert mit Datenstand 25.6., 0.00 Uhr, auf 1,11 (Vortag: 1,17). It shows the infection from 8 to 16 days ago. 04.45 Uhr: Die Kliniken in Deutschland rechnen trotz erster Schritte zu einer Normalisierung noch für mehrere Monate mit einem Betrieb im Krisenmodus. \"Die Corona-Pandemie ist noch nicht vorbei\", sagte der Hauptgeschäftsführer der Deutschen Krankenhausgesellschaft, Georg Baum, der Nachrichtenagentur dpa. \"Frei gehaltene Personal- und Intensivkapazitäten sind weiter erforderlich - auch für eine mögliche zweite Welle im Herbst.\" Eine Rückkehr zur Regelversorgung wie vor Corona sei bis weit ins nächste Jahr hinein sicherlich nicht möglich. Die Zahl der Klinikaufnahmen von Covid-19-Patienten sinke insgesamt, diese belegten inzwischen auch weniger Intensivbetten mit künstlicher Beatmung. However, capacities would continue to be severely limited by the need for consistent infection prevention. A supply in a multi-bed room is hardly possible anymore, explained Baum. Corona also had clinics significantly higher case costs - separate intensive care and bed wards were necessary for Corona sufferers. Personal müsse so weit wie möglich getrennt eingesetzt werden. Bund und Länder hatten die Krankenhäuser Mitte März aufgefordert, alle planbaren Operationen und Aufnahmen auszusetzen. This should create precautionary free beds for corona patients, especially in intensive care units. Angesichts der langsameren Virus-Ausbreitung rief die Politik im April dazu auf, schrittweise wieder mehr OPs und andere wichtige Behandlungen aufzunehmen. 04.15 Uhr: Eine Mehrheit der Deutschen macht sich trotz lokal erhöhter Infektionszahlen einer Umfrage zufolge keine großen Sorgen über eine Ansteckung mit dem Coronavirus. Ihr Anteil betrage 75 Prozent, berichtet die ARD unter Berufung auf eine Studie von Infratest dimap. Große oder sehr große Sorgen machen sich demnach 24 Prozent der 1068 Befragten. Mitte März habe die Zahl mit 55 Prozent einen Höhepunkt erreicht. Anfang Mai sank der Wert und ist seither stabil bei rund einem Viertel der Deutschen. Befragt wurden die Umfrageteilnehmer am 23. und 24. Juni. 03.15 Uhr: Bundesgesundheitsminister Jens Spahn (CDU) hat nach dem Coronavirus-Ausbruch beim Fleischkonzern Tönnies vor einer Diskriminierung von Bürgerinnen und Bürgern aus Ostwestfalen gewarnt. Personen mit Autokennzeichen aus den betroffenen Kreisen Gütersloh und Warendorf seien beschimpft und ihre Wagen zerkratzt worden, sagte Spahn den Zeitungen der Funke Mediengruppe (Freitagsausgaben). Diese \"Art von Stigmatisierung\" sei falsch. Das Virus könne jeden in jeder Region zu jeder Zeit erwischen. Einzelne Bundesländer wollen Sommerurlauber aus Ostwestfalen nicht mehr beherbergen. Spahn riet dazu, sich als Betroffener freiwillig testen zu lassen. Wer einen frischen Test vorweisen könne und frei von dem Coronavirus sei, könne auch reisen. Nach dem Corona-Ausbruch in dem Fleischbetrieb in Rheda-Wiedenbrück hatten die Behörden in den Kreisen Gütersloh und Warendorf erstmals wieder weitreichende Beschränkungen des öffentlichen Lebens verfügt. Die Maßnahmen sind zunächst bis zum 30. Juni befristet. Betroffen sind davon insgesamt rund 640.000 Menschen. Am 31. Dezember wandte sich China erstmals an die Weltgesundheitsorganisation (WHO). In der Millionenstadt Wuhan häuften sich Fälle einer rätselhaften Lungenentzündung. Mittlerweile sind mehr als sieben Millionen Menschen weltweit nachweislich erkrankt, die Situation ändert sich von Tag zu Tag. Auf dieser Seite finden Sie einen Überblick über alle SPIEGEL-Artikel zum Thema. 02.30 a.m .: In the case of regional corona outbreaks, North Rhine-Westphalia's school minister Yvonne Gebauer should not always \"reflexively\" close the schools. If there were regional infections, one had to react \"selectively\", the FDP politician told the \"Kölner Stadt-Anzeiger\" (Friday). \"However, it cannot be the case that local decision-makers always reflexively close daycare centers and schools as the first and only measure\" if there are corona cases in the vicinity of schools, said Gebauer. \"Da wünsche ich mir eine differenzierte Betrachtungsweise - und keinen Aktionismus zulasten unserer Kinder.\" Due to the corona outbreak at the meat producer Tönnies, the schools in the Warendorf district have been closed since Thursday. In the neighboring district of Gütersloh they have been closed for a few days. 02:00: From Saturday, the Danes are allowed to travel to most European countries again, as the government in Copenhagen announced on Thursday. The prerequisite for lifting the travel warning is above all that the number of new infections in the respective country is less than 20 per 100,000 inhabitants. The Danes are still advised against traveling to Great Britain, Ireland, Malta, Portugal, Romania and almost all regions of Sweden. On June 15, Denmark had already opened its borders again to Germans, Norwegians and Icelanders. Die erneute Lockerung zeige, dass die Situation in großen Teilen Europas besser sei als noch vor Kurzem gedacht, erklärte Außenminister Jeppe Kofod. Norway wants to further relax its travel restrictions, which are currently the strictest in Europe, on July 15, as Prime Minister Erna Solberg announced. The country, which is not a member of the EU but belongs to the Schengen area, has currently closed its borders for most foreigners without residence in Norway. Foreign travel is not officially prohibited for the Norwegians themselves, but a ten-day quarantine is required on return. The quarantine regulation is now to be lifted. Voraussetzung sei, dass in jedem Land bestimmte Kriterien erfüllt seien, sagte Solberg. Eine entsprechende Länderliste solle am 10. Juli veröffentlicht und regelmäßig aktualisiert werden. Norway opened its borders for its neighbors Denmark, Finland and Iceland on June 15, but not for Sweden. Norway has reported 8793 corona infections and 249 deaths so far, Denmark 12,836 cases and 603 deaths. 1.30 a.m .: Mexico's Finance Minister Arturo Herrera announced on Thursday that he had tested positive for the corona virus. He has only mild symptoms and will now work from home, Herrera wrote on Twitter. It is currently unclear how closely he was in contact with President Andres Manuel López Obrador recently. In Mexiko ist die Zahl der offiziell registrierten Infektionen auf mehr als 200.000 und die der Todesopfer auf mehr als 25.000 gestiegen. According to the government on Thursday (local time), 6104 infections with the Sars-CoV-2 pathogen and 1024 deaths from Covid-19 disease were added in the previous 24 hours. Die wahren Zahlen dürften allerdings noch deutlich höher liegen, da nur äußerst wenige Menschen getestet werden. Mehrere lateinamerikanische Länder gehören derzeit zu den Brennpunkten der globalen Pandemie - rund vier Monate, nachdem die ersten Fälle in der Region erfasst wurden. Brasilien steht mit offiziell mehr als 1,2 Millionen Infizierten und rund 55.000 Toten in beiden Kategorien weltweit nur hinter den USA. In Brasilien wie in Mexiko ist der jeweilige Präsident dafür in die Kritik geraten, die Pandemie nicht ernst genug zu nehmen. 1:00 a.m .: The number of new corona infections in the USA continues to climb and is at its highest level in weeks. Recently, there were 37,667 new cases, bringing the total to around 2.374 million, the CDC said. On Wednesday there were 34,313 and on Tuesday 26,643. The number of deaths now increases by 692 to 121,809. In comparison, the daily value on June 1 was around 17,400 new infections. The United States is the world's most affected by the pandemic in terms of the number of people infected. 12:47: The bank stress test turned out to be positive, but the US Federal Reserve wants the financial institutions to hold their money together in the face of the corona crisis - and initially prohibits share buybacks and dividend increases. Read more here. 00:20: The city of Göttingen is canceling the corona-related quarantine for an entire residential complex this Thursday at midnight. The city announced on Wednesday evening. The primary goal of the quarantine was to limit the outbreak of infection locally, to protect the entire population and also to prevent it from spreading beyond the urban area. The measures ordered had had an effect, said Petra Broistedt, Social Affairs Director and head of the staff for extraordinary events in the city of Göttingen. For this reason, the building quarantine can be lifted as planned. However, individual quarantines, such as those of infected people or first-degree contact persons, remain. A total of 600 secondary tests were carried out, according to the information. Only four other people had a positive test result. These are contact persons for infected people in a family environment. Vom Freitag bis zunächst 30. Juni (Dienstag) werden am Ein- und Ausgang des Komplexes noch Kontrollen durchgeführt, um sicherzustellen, dass einzelne Bewohner mit Quarantänepflicht das Gebäude nicht verlassen. The roughly 700 residents were not allowed to leave the building complex, or were only allowed to leave after some 120 of them had tested positive. Lower Saxony's Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) praised the city's crisis management. \"The authorities are very attentive and very committed, they go into problematic situations very early on and are very consistent. They are currently able to encapsulate the infections,\" he said during a visit to Göttingen. 12:10 AM: As the number of infections rises rapidly, the US state of Texas puts further easing of the coronavirus restrictions on hold. Governor Greg Abbott said Thursday that further phases of the reopening will be suspended for now. However, previous loosening would not be reversed. \"As we see an increase in Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations, we are focusing on strategies to slow the spread of the virus while allowing Texans to make money for their families,\" said the Republican Party politician, President Donald Trump. \"Closing business is the last thing we want as a state.\" The current pause in corona loosening will help curb the spread of the virus, Abbott said. The governor called on the population to wear protective masks, to wash their hands regularly and to observe distance rules. Texas and a number of other US states are currently experiencing the highest number of new coronavirus infections since the crisis began.\n",

            " Facebook is under increasing pressure due to its controversial handling of racist, inflammatory and manipulative content. Now the crackdown on Hatespeech and false information should also affect the company financially: The consumer goods manufacturer Unilever announced that it would no longer publish US advertising on the online network by the end of the year. This should also apply to the Facebook subsidiary Instagram. Unilever also commits the short message service Twitter - there should also be no advertising for the time being. After the announcement, the shares of Facebook and Twitter fell by around seven percent each. Unilever's decision was based on the responsibility of companies to deal with controversial contributions online - especially in view of the tense political atmosphere in the United States and the upcoming presidential election in November. Continuing to advertise on the online platforms is of no value to people and society, the Dutch-British group said. \"The polarized atmosphere places an increased responsibility on brands to build a trustworthy and secure digital ecosystem,\" Unilever wrote on Twitter. At this point you will find external content from Twitter that complements the article. You can show it with a click and hide it again.\n",
            "I consent to the display of external content. This enables personal data to be transmitted to third-party platforms.\n",

            " This means that an ad boycott against the platform that started last week is gaining significant influx. The previous day, the US telecommunications company Verizon had announced that it would suspend its advertising on Facebook. Ice cream maker Ben & Jerry's, which is part of the Unilever group, and outdoor clothing groups Patagonia and North Face had also announced that they would delete ads. The organization Anti-Defamation League had previously called for a boycott of Facebook as part of a campaign under the motto \"Stop the hate for profit\". Unilever does not want to cut its US advertising budget, the planned expenditure is now to be distributed to other companies. Facebook announced that it plans to act more strongly against hate news in the future and to delete false reports before the US presidential election. Incorrect content that should prevent people from voting in the three days immediately before the November vote would be removed, said Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg. In addition, the standards for advertising would be raised to block derogatory and hateful messages regarding ethnicity, religion or sexual preferences. Zuckerberg also announced that some Facebook content that actually violates the guidelines of the social network but is relevant to news, for example due to a prominent sender, will be flanked with information in the future. \"I'm against hatred and anything that incites violence,\" said Zuckerberg. Facebook generates almost all of its revenue from advertising revenue. The US wave of protests against racism and police violence has flared up criticism of Facebook for carelessly handling controversial posts.

            " The \"Isar noise\" promises a very special high. For some through music, for some through drugs - but some also have to stay outside. At the 2017 Elektro Festival, a man from Bavaria, now in his late 40s, was turned away. The bouncer found that he was too old for the party on Praterinsel. The man soberly remembered the General Equal Treatment Act, which prohibits discrimination on grounds of origin, gender, but also age. But it's not quite that simple. The 44-year-old at the time of the inspection felt deprived of the right to party and demanded compensation from the organizer of EUR 1,000. After he refused, the man went to court. There, however, he has lost in two instances and is now trying to file an appeal with the Federal Court of Justice. But his prospects are obviously bad. Because the law, as the judge at the Munich district court referred to, allows different treatment of people because of their age - if there is a factual reason for it. In a mass business like in department stores, for example, age discrimination must not be used. Other things may apply, however, if an individual selection of the contract partner precedes. And in the strict eye of the bouncer, according to the court, there was exactly such a selection - and there was also a good reason: \"At such disco events, the focus is not only on the music, but on celebrating together,\" the court decided . \"Therefore, a selection of guests to make a successful evening is reasonable, in order to do justice to the interests of the guests and the organizer.\" From the court's point of view, the plaintiff could have simply gone to another party. Following this reasoning, organizers of over-30 parties may also reject younger people. After the organizer had stated, according to a court spokesman about his Facebook campaign, that in the case of \"Isarrauschens\" primarily younger audiences should be addressed, the regional court of Munich I endorsed this assessment at the end of March - and rejected the appeal. The target group was young people between the ages of 18 and 28. It didn't help that the older party guest had in the first instance brought his much younger partner into the field. His argument: After all, she wouldn't be with him if he didn't look young. He didn't look that old at all and therefore found the rejection extremely offensive. When and whether the BGH will decide on the case is unclear. Case number BGH VII ZR 78/20 / Munich District Court 122 C 5020/18\n",

            " When Roman D. crossed the border from Belarus to Poland on August 3 last year, he raised no suspicion among the officials. He was driving an Infiniti Q50 from the car manufacturer Nissan. According to the passport, he was a Russian citizen from Saint Petersburg. He had a valid visa for the Schengen area. And so he was able to travel to Poland on that Saturday at 1:42 p.m. - and thus into the European Union with its open internal borders. Almost eleven months later, the trip is part of an explosive process in Germany. Investigators from the Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) and the Federal Prosecutor's Office suspect that Roman D. might have been involved in the preparation of the Berlin zoo murder in August 2019. Attorney General Peter Frank last week charged the alleged perpetrator, the Russian citizen Vadim Krasikov, with the alleged murder of exiled Chechen Zelimkhan Khangoshvili on behalf of the government of Vladimir Putin. Research by SPIEGEL and the investigative platform Bellingcat suggests that Putin's secret service FSB was involved in the attack. This leaves the accusation of state terrorism in the room. It is a spectacular case, in Germany it can only be compared to the 1992 attack on Mykonos, in which Iranian agents stormed a restaurant in Berlin and killed four opponents of the regime.

            " Do you have to say anything about the farce \"taz\" police - Seehofer? Not really, because if you talk about it long enough, it won't get better. Perhaps the connection between the police and capitalism would be worth discussing, which the columnist of \"taz\", in a way that has remained puzzling to me, has brought about in an \"if - but - then\" sequence: If the police are gone and capitalism is there, then the garbage dump. We cannot follow. Maybe the word \"capitalism\" somehow came out of the unconscious into the text, and the author actually wanted to say \"apple bag\"? Perhaps you can only write columns about athlete's foot or carnival at \"taz\" if the word \"capitalism\" appears in it. Or you think that it is so, or that it might not hurt. In any case, in the history of the world so far, it seems to me that capitalism has produced a police force, but the police force has not produced any capitalism. Rather, with real non-capitalism, it has always entered into a particularly intimate love affair; which maybe lies in the nature of things. Born in 1953, is a legal scientist and was chairman of the 2nd criminal senate of the Federal Court of Justice. He is the author of an annually revised standard short commentary on the Criminal Code and numerous other specialist books. If someone in Germany is insulted, is or feels insulted, the Germanist people begin to think about the question of what satire is allowed to do. After a long back and forth and exploring all the possibilities, someone comes up with the surprising idea that satire can do anything that is proven by the fact that someone said it before, but the courts themselves brought actions for defamation and therefore perhaps only meant their own satires . The also very elaborate counter-theory is that satire is not allowed to do everything. Finally, there is the wise means theory, which depends on it, as well as the thesis that satire is allowed to do everything, but not everything is satire. In such a theoretical dispute, the Federal Constitutional Court almost only helps, which has a divine sole right of representation for all questions of opinion, belief and assertion. However, it does not help in this case, because the Karlsruhe theory, with a loud grumble of popular sentiment, says that insult and art are not mutually exclusive, nor is it satire and defamation, so that since art is autonomous, it depends on whether satire is it want to be yourself. And that really does not help, because what man wants as an artist is precisely the question - why every recipient should rely on the artwork rather than the artist. For centuries, the public has been working on the question of whether a dog's heap turns from rubbish to art when you place it on a golden plate and garnish with crispy nibbles and a little smooth parsley, and central feuilletons of the \"baker's flower\" or \"taz\" with the drawn humor continue to like to stare at a few stupid museum visitors in front of the light switch. As we know, the range of satirical art is so wide that in the relevant television formats the roaring pleasure of the claqueurs, who are degraded as \"studio audiences\", is the only indicator of the popular feeling outside in the country: \"heute-show\", Mr. Nuhr or \"Mario Barth \"Without faking live roaring are as satirical as three-week-old hand cheese with music. Great satirists preceded the \"taz\" columnist: Mr. Böhmermann, for example, who stated in rhymed form that a Turkish president is a goat fucker, so that this act proves a satire aimed at specific Turkish agriculture that is prohibited in Germany, to call foreign presidents \"Ziegenficker\". The Federal Government used this to immediately remove the penal provision against insulting foreign presidents from the law, so that freedom of expression lived and satire was allowed to do everything. The satirical German people found this very good, because you could show it to the Anatolian goatherds. We'll see how satirical things will be when a Turk publishes a nice long poem about the Federal President in \"Hürriyet\" to remind us of what is not allowed in Turkey, but typically occasionally in Germany did. Out of 100 people who comment on what satire is allowed to do or not, probably 95 have not yet thought about what satire is, apart from a word and a trigger for tapping the thighs, and what the \"must\" refers to. Of course there are exceptions. For example, the people of Stuttgart, Dresden and Munich are inherently satirists, while the Hanoverians and Rostockers still have to google the word. The garbage. Death and the city. Anatolia and dump. We remember there was something. A satirist said: Hopefully we will soon dispose of those who do not belong here in Anatolia. The \"taz\" was not amused at all, but rather outraged. The one and the other filed criminal complaints, but the public prosecutor was simply sovereign in dealing with sensitivity and satire (literature reference: Fischer / Gärditz, sedition in Eichsfeld, \"Strafverwehr\" 2018, pp. 491 - 494). The lady of the \"taz\" wrote: When the police are abolished, police officers should work in the landfill, \"on the heap, where they are really only surrounded by garbage. They certainly feel most comfortable among their own kind.\" In this arrangement there are only two parties: \"you\" (police officers) and \"garbage\". \"You\" and \"Police Officer\" are the same; So the sentence does not mean that police officers feel most comfortable among police officers. You would not need to bring them to the heap for this. Rather, they feel most comfortable where they are \"really only surrounded by waste\", because the waste is \"their peers\". If words should still have meanings, this sense of the sentence is obvious; no editorial, columnist or other little mouse bites a thread. So let's leave the senseless \"interpretation\" according to the degree of personal incompetence and state policy dream interpretation. When A says to B that he is rubbish, it does not mean that B is a golden ring. Not even if a gold ring was found on the garbage dump three years ago in Rio. Of course, great ghosts come up with all sorts of nice foggy words, \"freedom of the press\" away, \"satire\" afterwards, \"authenticity\" is also included. But the audience is not completely stupid either: Anyone who says \"their like rubbish\" does not have to come with Karl Kraus afterwards. A look into the hollow spaces of the opinion of the Internet shows that an extraordinarily large number of people are of the opinion that firstly they know what is good and what is bad satire, secondly what is allowed and illegal satire, thirdly what is satire. Of course, I myself also have an opinion. I can not see what about the statement that policemen felt most comfortable in the garbage because it was \"their peers\" could be satirical. It does not matter if the whole thing is placed in a fictional context in which an author considers what \"should\" happen to the staff of a professional group. It is touching when young people dream of omnipotence; As we know, this happens occasionally even to party leaders who are thinking about what \"should\" happen to the rich after the revolution. But, as we suspect, that was also not an art. If you want to know whether it is satire to say that police officers are rubbish, you shouldn't ask police officers. The policemen's soul, like that of journalists and freedom fighters, is rather tender, as far as their own honor is concerned, and the policeman's humor deals more with the \"clientele\" in his professional form, whereby he tends towards extremely popular satire. Even populations who, in the opinion of many friends and helpers, are too understanding or mild towards the \"clientele\" often enjoy satirical contributions to the discussion by policemen who write and talk - I only say: psychologists, sociologists, family judges, social workers, \"good people\", \"writers\" ... But all of this can be left out if it doesn't matter. Because whether you say \"satire\" to a text or \"a sandwich\" doesn't matter if there are no consequences other than a small misunderstanding or an unquenched appetite. So whether the equation \"policemen = waste\" in the opinion of non-policemen in Berlin is funny art, does not matter if there are no legal consequences. This is again about criminal law, which, in the opinion of most, is made just for such cases and with the purpose of putting the cheeky and outrageous and dangerous and wrong in its place. We think of \"insult\" (§ 185 StGB) and \"sedition\" (§ 130 StGB). Nothing else, please, because it is neither a factual claim, nor a threat, nor treason or coercion, and what the suggestions are. However, both § 185 and § 130 of the Criminal Code require a certain degree of clarification: you should be able to see who is actually meant. \"Police officers\" are a group of people that are thought to include tens of millions of people worldwide. In the \"taz\" there was no mention of \"German police officers\", \"Berlin police officers\" or \"police officers of the XY district\". We remember: \"Soldiers\" were rightly not enough for the Federal Constitutional Court as an insultable collective; Even \"doctors\", \"judges\", \"bankers\", \"professional athletes\", \"homeowners\", \"civil servants\" are not all insulting under this name. And a \"part of the domestic population\" in the sense of § 130 StGB are not \"police officers\" either. That is why humorous, concerned citizens are allowed to write, for example, with impunity, \"Politicians are corrupt\" or \"Officials are criminals\". It’s brain tearing, but that’s it. So it becomes really difficult with the criminal prosecution of the poor little columnist, who only made a poor little joke. If you don't believe it, try going to the nearest police station and filing a criminal complaint because a police officer said that \"refugees\" were all criminal. Enjoy the fate of this ad! But perhaps such competent organizations as the German Police Union have only filed a criminal complaint because they suspect how it will work out, but would like to use this result for further highly intelligent campaigns. Should have already happened. Where it is all about having a strong, correct opinion, everything is allowed - in politics as in satire. Now to the Federal Minister of the Interior. He said he was considering filing criminal charges. Germany trembled. The minister considered it and considered it. He said his criminal complaint was a very serious one. He held talks, even with \"his lawyers\". Then the head of the Federal Press Office announced that the minister's talks with the Federal Chancellery continued. Then the minister canceled a press conference. Then the decision was considered again, then there was silence, then the announcement was canceled, then announced. The birth on June 25: no criminal charges. Do you do the same if you are considering filing a criminal complaint? Do you publish a press release in your local newspaper stating that you are considering filing criminal charges against Mr. X or Ms. Y? And if so: do you wonder if you are then considered to be an intolerable punk? If you answer yes to both questions, I think you have a problem. But that is not because of Mr. X or Mrs. Y. The story was particularly exciting, of course, because for \"sedition\" (§ 130 StGB) no criminal complaint and no criminal complaint are required at all. And as far as an application for insult would be necessary, the Federal Minister of the Interior is not responsible for all state police officers; he is not their supervisor (see § 194 StGB). Everything a bit oblique in the wind! However, I have to confess that the relationship of the Federal Minister of the Interior to his personal decisions is not something that really interests me. I don't care much about the opinions of unsuspecting columnists about the police in general. In addition to the criminal procedural and civil service law-related performance, I find it interesting that the performance is stupidly different: the public's handling of the information, the minister is considering filing a criminal complaint against Ms. Y. You have to mention briefly what a criminal complaint is. Section 160 (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that as soon as the public prosecutor's office learns of the suspicion of a criminal offense by way of a complaint or other means, it must investigate the matter to determine whether the public action should be brought. A criminal complaint is therefore a notification to the public prosecutor that a criminal offense is suspected. Since prosecutors are few and far between, most criminal complaints are not accepted by prosecutors, but by their \"investigators\". These are police officers above a certain level who, as part of their duties, also carry out criminal prosecution - according to the instructions of the public prosecutor's office. A \"police officer\" can make a \"complaint\" without notice, \"ex officio\": Then he is the complainant himself. Anyone can file criminal charges. You don't have to be of legal age, you don't have to be German, you don't have to be legally competent or responsible. It is not a legal declaration, but a purely actual process. It doesn't even have to know the identity of the person who made the complaint: if you dial the emergency number, say \"A murder has happened here\", and then hang up, it was also a criminal complaint. Legally relevant declarations such as \"criminal complaint\", request for notification, etc. must be distinguished from the mere actual notification that triggers the obligation to investigate § 160 StPO. In the case of so-called \"official offenses\", the notification is sufficient. In the case of so-called \"application offenses\" - for example insulting - a \"criminal complaint of the injured person\" has to be added because the state judiciary should not intervene ex officio in the private trade of the citizens. The official can also file a criminal complaint with officials. As I said, Mr. Seehofer is the superior of many people, but certainly not the police officer of Berlin and Los Angeles. The content of an advertisement is that there is \"suspicion of a crime\". You don't have to call it that. Suffice it to say: my car has a dent. Mr. X hit it with a hammer. It is then up to the public prosecutor to check whether this could be a car murder, property damage or a bad joke and whether there is \"suspected crime\". You have to know whether hitting cars with hammers can be a criminal offense. Not more. When a federal minister files a lawsuit, it is almost as important as when you or your grandmother do. It may be that someone sees it differently and that a federal minister might want his criminal complaints to be received like heavenly revelations, but this is only important for the ranking on the important-person scale, not for the matter. As we know, we live in a republic. For some time now, the aristocracy has been abolished in the area of ​​what is now Germany; and we haven't had a caste system in the past 1500 years. As the \"taz\" columnist would not forget to mention, \"in capitalism\" there are all free, formally identical citizens. When the Basic Law says \"everyone\", it does not mean all white old women, but all people, without distinction. Price query time June 26th, 2020 11.33 pm No guarantee \"Tell us how we can do it now and forever!\", Said the Bavarian politician Goppel in 1980. His prayer was directed to a higher power; this had a residence in Rott am Inn. And his co-administrator Heubl added: \"Franz Josef, you have the floor. Give us hope and prospect and opportunity and future!\". These were the times when the announcement that the future giver was considering filing a criminal complaint about bad beer could easily have resulted in pilgrimages to hostile hosts to Rott in the Free State. Nowadays, one would hope that the Attorney General's Office would not make a pilgrimage to the master to tell them the outcome of the trial. It is all the more miraculous to what extent the longing for a being in the soul of the common people, like the classic, global elite of journalism, is for a being who says how to do it, for all time. Of course, not without further ado: A bit of \"refraction\" must already be in there. A little bit of shame. And a lot of anticipated anger and malicious glee, in case of failure. The completely normal petty-bourgeois crawl that the Franz-Josefs and the Erichs and the Donalds appreciate so much. Chief doctors from the Glottertal and captains of dream ships know what it is like when the therapy fails and the steamer is stranded on the iceberg, and a federal president from Lower Saxony is also familiar with the \"Bild\" elevator. The premium press knows it too, but pretends irony and does the opposite. It would have been correct to tell the Federal Minister of the Interior on page one that he should not act so embarrassingly and not ridicule him for the office. The same could be said to a few police unionists. If the minister and his entourage of B 11 to B 6 officials \"consider filing criminal charges,\" then they may do what they cannot do. Consider, act or not. Announcements and press conferences that you \"consider\" this are not only warm air, they even smell a bit harsh, because they deal with the assumption of a special meaning that does not exist at all. As far as can be seen, the Minister was seriously of the opinion that the world was waiting for the outcome of his \"consideration\". This his message, for which he has found compliant headlines and windmakers for a whole week, is aimed at people who are uneducated, prejudiced, uncertain. They live in a world where \"the police\" detain criminals and the bad guys are lost as soon as the Minister files a criminal complaint. It is a shame that the actors know about stupidity and do it for this very reason. They do not respect people: not the voters whose supplications they dream of, and not the police officers who are supposed to protect them, but in reality pay poorly, treat them poorly, train them poorly and use them poorly. The Eskias and Walters, the columnists and \"union bosses\", are marginalized, based on \"general suspicion\" and \"party scenes\", bramara-based, popular mood and corona trauma. In the matter, dear children, nothing has happened.\n",

            " Chromebooks, i.e. notebooks with Google's Chrome OS operating system, are relatively rare in Germany. They are popular in the American school system because they can be used alternately by several users, who each find their own personal work environment, their own files and apps. In addition, the installation is very simple, which is important in schools, whose employees often do not abound with IT skills. Because it uses Chrome OS, all of this also applies to the IdeaPad Duet Chromebook from Lenovo. Switch on, connect WiFi and log in with a Google account, and you're ready to go. Gmail users have immediate access to their mails, calendars and addresses as well as all data stored in the Google cloud. The cloud data is cached in the device's internal memory so that you can continue working without a network connection. Google has now moved away from the original Chrome OS concept of only running all apps in the Chrome browser. Instead, you have access to the Play Store and its Android apps. This way, you can also use the corresponding apps to access data that you have stored in the Microsoft cloud or at Dropbox. The Duet Chromebook is reminiscent of Microsoft's Surface Pro. The supplied keyboard docks onto the underside of the tablet via five spring pins, a kickstand integrated into the magnetically held back holds the tablet upright and is continuously adjustable from steep to very flat. The back is covered with a coarse fabric and feels very high quality. The gray aluminum housing of the tablet has a light blue plastic band at the top, behind which the antennas for Bluetooth and WLAN are hidden. There is no LTE. The back of the IdeaPad is protected by a coarse material, the blue border shows where the antennas are. The tablet has two cameras. The eight-megapixel rear camera records video in Full HD (1920 by 1080 pixels), the two-megapixel front camera delivers 1600 by 1200 pixels. These cameras will only be used for video conferences. This works quite well because, like notebooks, the front camera is placed over the longer side of the 10.1-inch display. Unlike the iPad, you don't squint to the side. The Duet is charged via USB-C from a supplied ten-watt power supply. It should last up to ten hours on one charge. Instead of a headphone jack, a small adapter for 3.5 millimeter headsets is included, which then blocks the only port. Alternatively, you can use the stereo microphones and speakers on the top. The keyboard is tight, especially in the right area, where the umlauts are. Lenovo has to make compromises here, otherwise the keyboard cover will be larger than the tablet. The keys are not backlit, have a sufficient drop and are typically labeled with lower case letters. The Duet's IPS touchscreen has a Full HD resolution, i.e. 1920 by 1080 pixels. With a pen that complies with the USI specification (Universal Stylus Initiative), you can draw on the display or write notes. All new Chromebooks will support this standard. The standardization of the hardware allows Google very long update cycles. So this Duet Chromebook should receive updates until at least 2028. It automatically becomes the most durable Android tablet. Price inquiry time June 26th, 2020 11:34 pm No guarantee The tablet itself is 456 grams light, but there are also 234 grams for the back with kickstand and 264 grams for the keyboard. You end up with a pummel that weighs almost a kilogram, which is not particularly slim, but makes a very robust impression. Except for the tightly cut keyboard, the device shows no weaknesses, the MTK octacore processor clocked with two gigahertz had no trouble with videos, apps or the Chrome browser. The memory configuration with four gigabytes (GB) of RAM and 64 GB of mass storage is adequate for a Chromebook. For little more money, there is also 128 GB of memory, which is only worthwhile if you want to save a lot of media or apps on the device. Pro Inexpensive Flexible to use Updates until 2028 Contra No fingerprint sensor No headphone jack Narrow, unlit keyboard For people who are at home in the Google ecosystem with Android, the IdeaPad Duet Chromebook is a stunner. Setup and operation are simple. And it is good for the whole family because several users can log on to each other and everyone can find their own personal environment. Editor's note: Originally, this article stated that the MTK processor was clocked at two megahertz. We have corrected this error and ask you to excuse the oversight.\n",

            " Constant price war, problematic conditions for humans and animals: Federal Agriculture and Food Minister Julia Klöckner (CDU) is pressing for fundamental changes in the meat market. \"There will be no second chance for the entire industry,\" said Klöckner after meeting industry and association representatives in Düsseldorf. The corona crisis with the large outbreak of infection at meat producer Tönnies is like a burning glass for the situation. Klöckner announced that it would consider tightening the law on pricing and food advertising with enticing prices. She wants to talk to the party and parliamentary leaders in the Bundestag about a possible animal welfare tax as a price premium for consumers. An overarching consensus is needed for this. Klöckner again campaigned for a voluntary animal welfare logo for meat from better husbandry. Klöckner, her North Rhine-Westphalian colleague Ursula Heinen-Esser (CDU) and Lower Saxony's head of department Barbara Otte-Kinast (CDU) had invited to the meeting. Representatives of animal owners, the slaughter industry, trade, animal and consumer protection groups took part in the meeting. The meat industry had previously given up resistance to a ban on work contracts. The Association of the Meat Industry announced that it would support the federal government's proposed law. Initial implementations by member companies showed the seriousness with which the industry as a whole is striving to reverse the previous practice and to end the system of work contracts in slaughtering and cutting, it said. At the end of May, the federal cabinet decided on key points for new regulations in the meat industry. The key point is an extensive ban on contracts for work as of January 1, 2021 - these are currently often used to purchase the complete execution of slaughtering and cutting work from subcontractors. According to SPIEGEL information, the food discounter Aldi has asked its meat suppliers to improve working conditions in the industry and to comply with standards. So the company insists on its suppliers to \"produce goods under decent and fair working conditions\". It is expected that \"social standards, including in the area of ​​accommodation for employees\", will also be observed for work contracts. Aldi Nord and Aldi Süd also announced new inspections of the slaughterhouses and obliged the companies to adapt their hygiene concepts.\n",

            " the success of an attack depends on the weak points of the opponent. And their perfect exploitation. A virus is masterful in it. It appropriately appropriates the resources of its host for its own replication, often deceives the immune system and often mutates in such a way that the host stays alive as long as possible despite illness - so that it infects many other hosts. The spread of a virus in one place or in a group of people indicates weaknesses. Be it pre-existing conditions that make people more vulnerable, lack of vaccination protection or external circumstances. However, the deficits that the novel corona virus shows us have an astonishing number of political implications. And there are weaknesses that we knew about, but we often preferred to keep silent or to look away for too long. Covid-19 disease now acts as a truth serum on society. It proves impressively that populists in the government are not only undesirable, but dangerous to the life and limb of their populations, as can be seen in Brazil and Great Britain, whose heads of government fail in the virus crisis; if you still need proof that Trump is not a strong statesman who makes America \"big\", you can get it every day by looking at the curve of the number of infected people; It was known in theory that globalization based on the division of labor is not only efficient, but also poses supply risks, but for a long time it was not important for us in practice. And in Germany? Well, our schools did not do quite as well in the Pisa tests, but it was only the corona crisis that made it clear how much action needed to be taken in digitization, for example. And it is no coincidence that the virus strikes fully in meat processing: crowded people who malouch under enormous pressure and lousy working conditions - for a wage that only enables life in mass accommodations. Of course, many knew that \"cheap\" meat entails follow-up costs, but how long it is and who bears it could be suppressed for a long time. Until now. \"Crime scene Tönnies - How the brutal business with cheap meat becomes a danger to people\" is the title of the new SPIEGEL. You will now receive the issue digitally and from Saturday at the kiosk. Meat processing at Tönnies (archive photo): Open flank for the Tönnies crime scene: The cutlet emperor and his brutal deal in cheap meatWhat role did Clemens Tönnies play in the devastating Corona outbreak? What are the conditions in his battle empire? And what does politics want to do now? Read the SPIEGEL cover story here. Corona outbreak in Gütersloh: The lockdown, part two, mass tests, police controls, massive restrictions: In the Gütersloh district, the corona crisis flared up again after the outbreak at the meat manufacturer Tönnies. What that means, politically and practically. Corona spread: risk factor in the meat business Almost all infected employees at Tönnies work in meat cutting, where slaughtered animals are broken down in a chord. It is cool there - apparently the ideal place for the spread of the corona virus. Quarantine, ban on accommodation, negative tests: these are the corona travel restrictions of the federal states. Many Germans have long since written off summer vacations abroad. But it can also be difficult domestically - if you come from risky regions with acute outbreaks. An overview of the rules.

Ex-Lufthansa manager: \"I couldn't have imagined what was going on there\" The state has to save Lufthansa, which makes ex-board member Thierry Antinori sad. In the interview, he tells how the industry can best get through the crisis - and why he feels good at BER this time. Contacts with infected people: Corona app alarms first users Anyone who is in the vicinity of infected people could be alerted today by the German Corona warning app. So far, around two dozen users are said to have entered a Covid 19 infection in the app. Virus Crisis: Corona Infections in the USA Reach New Record Almost 40,000 people have been tested positive for the corona virus within 24 hours in the USA, according to several surveys - more than ever before. Corona crisis: why Sweden has so many Covid 19 deaths Sweden wanted to go its own way through the corona crisis. Now the country has more deaths per capita than France and is approaching Italy. The containment of the virus has failed. Coronavirus in Nigeria: \"We are still at the beginning\" Nigeria was seen as a model example in corona prevention. Now one of the worst outbreaks in Africa is suspected there. There are many deaths - contrary to the official number of cases. The dead, the perpetrators, the investigations: the Ischgl file The pandemic spread from almost all of Europe to a ski village in Tyrol. A team of SPIEGEL reporters have reconstructed the case: who failed, who looked away - and who has to pay for it. Hardly any traffic jams, less noise, clean air: How Corona made our cities more livable Scientists learned a lot during the pandemic what positive effects it would be if the streets were quieter. What do we learn from this? Visiting ban in the nursing home: \"Are you coming tomorrow?\" At the very beginning of the lockdown, an old woman with dementia has to go to the nursing home. Her children are not allowed to go to her for weeks. The siblings start a fight - so that their mother doesn't forget them. Easy course, serious damage: three Covid-19 patients and their mysterious relapses When 30-year-old Simon S. fell ill with Covid-19, he was hardly worried. But weeks after his recovery, the symptoms came back, worse than before. Reports of this kind are piling up - doctors cannot explain them. Yours Kurt Stukenberg We have put together all the answers to the most important questions about the corona virus for you here. You can find further current developments at SPIEGEL.de.\n",

            " As the pandemic progresses, doctors understand better and better what the novel coronavirus Sars-CoV-2 can do to the body. It is now clear that the pathogen not only attacks the lungs, but also the heart, brain, kidneys and blood vessels. Now doctors in a letter to the journal New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) report that Covid-19 could possibly trigger diabetes. Scientists often use this route to alert colleagues to suspicions. Diabetes, also known as diabetes, stands for various metabolic disorders that can cause extremely fluctuating blood sugar levels because patients do not produce enough insulin. If the suspicion is confirmed, it could be a new form of diabetes that is probably the most comparable to type 1 diabetes. In these cases, the immune system attacks the pancreatic beta cells that produce insulin. As a result, the body can no longer control the sugar level, which can be life-threatening. This type of diabetes usually occurs in childhood or young adulthood. \"Monitoring is important,\" Baptist Gallwitz of the German Diabetes Society told SPIEGEL. It is still not clear in detail what triggers type 1 diabetes. It has been suspected for years that virus infections could play a role. There are case reports of diabetes developing as part of an infection with Mumps, Rota or Coxsackie viruses. In addition, diagnoses of type 1 diabetes, in which cold viruses are also particularly prevalent, are increasing in the corresponding months. So far, however, there are only a few known cases of Covid-19 patients who were later diagnosed with diabetes. Doctors from Singapore reported a formerly healthy 37-year-old who was diagnosed with diabetes as a result of Covid 19 disease. He had been hospitalized with fever, diarrhea, and the urge to drink water all the time. In order to investigate the suspicion, an international team of leading diabetologists has created a registration register for suspected cases. Since millions of people worldwide have been proven to be infected with the corona virus, the connection could also be coincidental. \"Nevertheless, it is important to investigate the suspicion and understand who may be particularly at risk,\" says Gallwitz. However, the mechanism by which Covid-19 could trigger diabetes is still speculative. It would be conceivable that the virus destroys the beta cells in the pancreas that produce insulin. They have been proven to have the ACE-2 receptors, which the coronavirus uses as an entry gate. Once invaded, the pathogen causes the cell to make countless copies of the virus until it is finally destroyed. \"In this case, type 1 diabetes could theoretically even regress if there are still sufficient beta cells after a Covid-19 disease,\" says Gallwitz. Some patients also developed diabetes with the closely related coronavirus SARS. In many cases, the disease resolved after three years. However, it persisted in ten percent of the cases. Another possible explanation would be that when the immune system tries to get rid of the virus, it accidentally attacks the body's own beta cells. Such an autoimmune reaction is considered the most likely cause of type 1 diabetes and is not curable. \"This reaction could be demonstrated by testing for certain antibodies,\" Gallwitz continues. A correlation that is already evident in corona studies is that patients with type 2 diabetes are at higher risk of developing Covid-19. The organs of those affected are less sensitive to insulin. The beta cells therefore have to produce more until they are overwhelmed and die. In addition to hereditary predisposition, overweight and lack of exercise are also risk factors. However, it is difficult to assess the impact of diabetes alone on the course of Covid 19 disease. Often, those affected have comorbidities, such as being overweight or high blood pressure, which are also risk factors. British researchers recently reported that dexamethasone could significantly reduce mortality in seriously ill Covid-19 patients. However, the remedy also increases blood sugar levels. \"Diabetes patients must therefore be carefully monitored for this treatment,\" says Gallwitz, who also works as deputy medical director for internal medicine at the University Hospital in Tübingen. The pandemic is an additional burden for the seven million diabetes patients in Germany. Since many clinics had to switch to emergency operation in the meantime, they were forced to postpone preventive examinations. Diabetes is associated with complications that should be recognized as early as possible. Gallwitz emphasizes that it is now all the more important to keep blood sugar levels stable. An online consultation can help those affected. \"We have to do everything we can to stem the pandemic,\" says the doctor. \"But Covid-19 is not the only disease that Germany is struggling with.\" The goal of the health system must be to provide all patients with the best possible care.\n",

            " With the P40 Pro +, Huawei rounds off its smartphone offering. The Chinese company demands self-confident 1399 euros for its new high-end model. Compared to the 400 euro cheaper P40 Pro, you primarily get one more camera, a tenx zoom lens, double the storage space and a housing made of a material called nano-ceramic. This combination of words is more common in companies that offer paint seals for cars. Otherwise, the P40 Pro + is largely identical to the P40 Pro that Huawei introduced at the end of March. The equipment of the new model is correspondingly high-quality: The OLED screen, which is slightly curved on the sides, shows 2640 x 1200 pixels, can be very bright, has a very nice color display in \"Normal\" mode and, with a 90 Hz refresh rate, ensures that nothing jerky when scrolling. Can you tell which one is which? Exactly: On the left is a P40 Pro, on the right the 400 euro more expensive P40 Pro + The processor is also the same, namely Huawei's own Kirin 990 5G, which, as the name suggests, contains 5G technology. Accordingly, the P40 Pro + is already suitable for the new cellular networks. For this, two nano-SIM cards can be inserted, one of which can also be exchanged for a Huawei memory card. The WLAN module masters the new Wifi 6 standard and the memory of the Plus model has been doubled to 512 gigabytes. The cameras of the two P40-Pro variants separate. For example, the Plus model has a triple and a tenfold telephoto instead of a fivefold telephoto lens. The latter is built in like a periscope - with a rotating mirror - because the lenses required for it could not be squeezed into such a flat housing otherwise. The result is impressive for a smartphone photographer. The different optical zoom levels of the P40 Pro + in comparison, from top left to bottom right: ultra wide angle, wide angle, triple zoom and ten times zoom. The digital zoom, which allows zoom factors of up to 100 by software interpolation, can not inspire me that much. On the one hand, this only works with a tripod or at least a solid base, on the other hand, the software intervenes so vehemently in the recording that the surfaces, which often look like splashes of color, give the impression that the recording has been processed with a Photoshop filter. If you do without such digital gimmicks, the P40 Pro + usually takes good pictures. The sharpness is actually always good and, for example, the option of defocusing a background by changing the aperture afterwards is really fun. The colors often seem a bit exaggerated. The camera software emphasizes green and red in particular quite strongly. The following image clearly shows how differently the cameras from Huawei and Apple treat colors and background details: twice the same motif: taken on the left with the Huawei P40 Pro +, on the right with an iPhone 11 Pro Max. The software shows that Huawei is apparently preparing for it to deliver their smartphones in the long term without Google apps. Reminder: Due to the suspicion that the company could spy for the Chinese government, the United States has prohibited American companies from working with Huawei. A free version of the Android operating system is therefore installed on Huawei smartphones, but no Google service, i.e. no Gmail, no YouTube and no Play Store. The selection of apps is therefore very limited. Price query time June 26th, 2020 11:31 pm No guarantee Huawei tries to make up for this shortcoming with an app called Petal Search, which includes a search function for apps. For example, by entering the search mask, you can search several app providers that are not operated by Google for apps that are not available in Huawei's own store, the App Gallery. And that's a lot. In addition to the P40 Pro +, this search function is also available for other Huawei smartphones that are not supplied with Google software, depending on the model via the App Gallery or as an update of the system software. This method is problematic because the apps offered on alternative platforms are not subject to the same security controls as in the Play Store. To make up for this shortcoming, Huawei has integrated Avast software into its Android version, which checks new apps for known malware before installation. To what extent it can recognize all conceivable manipulations is unclear. What is certain is that you have to put a lot of trust in the different providers. And that you forego some comfort. The new Sonos app, for example, cannot be found in Huawei's sources, and even the latest update of the old Sonos app was only available a week after it was released. According to a company spokesman, a Huawei version of the Corona warning app released on Tuesday will have to wait around two to three weeks. Pro Extensive camera equipment with 10x zoom Very good workmanship Very good equipment Cons No Google software High price The hardware of the P40 Pro + is great. The ceramic housing is very scratch-resistant, the cameras offer options that you won't find anywhere else, the entire technical equipment including 5G is great. The lack of Google software determined by the United States remains a weak point. Even if you can now get apps from various sources and plug holes in Huawei's own app range, you are walking on thin ice. Because even if Huawei has built an automatic security check into the app installation process, it can hardly be checked whether an app manipulated by criminals does not slip through. We decide which products we report in the network world and which we test or not. We do not receive any money or other consideration from the manufacturer for any of the test reports. For various reasons, we may not report on products even though we have corresponding test products. We usually get test equipment and review copies of games free of charge for a certain period of time from the manufacturer, sometimes even before the official release. Our test reports can appear in good time or in time for the product's publication.\n",
            "We only test pre-release versions or devices from pre-series production in special cases. We usually wait until we can get test devices or game versions that are identical to the retail versions. In some cases, we also buy products at our own expense if they are already available in stores or online. As a rule, test devices are sent back to the manufacturers after the end of the test. Exceptions are review copies of games and so-called long-term loans: For example, we have game consoles and smartphones in the editorial office, which we can use for long periods. For example, we can report on software updates, new accessories and new games, or make long-term judgments. DER SPIEGEL always bears the costs for trips to events, regardless of whether they take place in Germany or abroad. This also applies if, for example, a company takes over travel planning due to short-term appointments. Events to which we travel at our own expense include the trade fairs Ifa, CES, E3 and Gamescom as well as events from companies such as Apple, Google, Microsoft or Nintendo. At conferences such as the Chaos Communication Congress or re: publica, we usually get free press tickets, like other press representatives, because we report on the conference and are not traditional participants. Since December 2016, some Netzwelt articles have included Amazon ads that contain so-called partner links. If a user visits Amazon via such a link and purchases online there, DER SPIEGEL will participate in the sales in the form of a commission.

            " At least for fetishists of creepy superlatives, the past few weeks have had a lot to offer. As bad as it was in the corona crisis, it was said that the economy had not crashed since the dark 1930s - when, we remember, millions of people were unemployed and the disaster ended in a world war. There have never been so many short-time workers. And the auto industry has never had to cut production so abruptly and drastically. No government has ever made so much debt so quickly. Crisis in the superlative. And now? Augurs suddenly report that common economic leading indicators are shooting up just as suspectly again. Like this week. The Ifo business climate index has never risen so sharply in a month. Purchasing managers surveyed would never have changed their assessment so quickly. What looks graphically as if it was a V. Is the great time of booming fantasies coming after the horror findings are staccato? Quite possible. Only behind the many positive reports threatens to be more appearances than reality. Which is solely due to the pitfalls of the common economic leading indicators. The real evidence of how severe the crisis is becoming could riskily come after the summer. An attempt at clarification. Born in 1965, has been managing the Internet portal WirtschaftsWunder since 2007. From 2002 to 2012 he was chief economist at the \"Financial Times Deutschland\". He is a co-founder of the \"Forum New Economy\", in which experts have come together to develop a new economic leitmotif. The pitfalls work for the good as before for the bad. On closer inspection, the mathematical comparisons to major historical crises were rather weird. Of course, quite spectacular sales crash rates come out when, say, a restaurant has to close overnight because people are afraid of getting infected. Minus 100 percent. For the time in question, the shrinking values ​​for the economy as a whole are just as impressive. Linking that to the 1930s alone is just gaga - back then, it wasn't an abrupt interruption out of caution about a virus, but the collapse of a banking system and the lack of government aid. According to gaga, it can also be said that the drop in gross domestic product (GDP) has now brought us back to the level of prosperity ten years ago, as a major business newspaper wrote these days. In the shock weeks of spring, very little was generated for a while, which means that the GDP alone is significantly lower over the year. Nonsense. That has nothing to do with the wealth itself. If there is a crash like now, then economic growth will not shrink, as hobby economists like to note - which is logically absurd. Then economic output shrinks. And if something shrinks, it cannot grow at the same time. The leading indicators based on surveys - such as the popular Ifo index - also proved to be tricky in the corona shock crisis. Companies are asked whether they expect business to rise or fall over the next three months. No wonder that everyone said \"falling\" in March and April when the corona crisis started. Rumms, index crash. Except that it does not say much about how much of the total economic output has really stayed and remains. One and the same decline in the index can mean that everyone expects just a little less sales - or all very much. The first is quite harmless, the second a disaster - but cannot be determined from the Ifo data. This is exactly where the problem lies in the opposite direction. It is enough if, after loosening the contact restrictions and waves of fear, almost everyone does at least a little more, which is not that difficult after reopening a business. The Ifo values ​​are already shooting as spectacularly as this week. Only without this saying anything about how much economic output is now being caught up. If everyone gets just a little more, the Ifo index will go off just as impressively as if it starts to rustle everywhere. There is also a problem with mathematics. If production in the auto industry has dropped to only 15 percent of the pre-crisis period, just a few reboots are enough to report a 100 percent increase - which means that only the industry in question is not getting back to pre-crisis level; and, if it stays that way, masses of people will soon be put on the streets. This would actually bring Germany much closer to the scenario of the 1930s. The recent Ifo surveys, for example, have a sobering effect: Despite the apparently spectacular improvement compared to the creepy Corona months, a clear majority of the companies estimate their own business situation even in June - clearly after the end of the contact bans - as \" bad \"a. And: There are still as many companies that expect even worse business for the next three months (as they already do) than those that expect at least improvement - although it should tend to get better everywhere after the shock condition has been lifted. Apparently, the crisis is currently continuing in many industrial companies because international supply chains are interrupted or there is a lack of demand from abroad. According to Ifo surveys, there are currently even more pessimists than optimists when it comes to exports. A real improvement looks different. The German export burden could be fatal. Which in turn could explain why similar surveys among purchasing managers for France have recently turned out to be more positive than ours. Although we were considered to be more robust. The misinterpretation could become a real drama if it is disregarded for the sheer positive reports that the crisis will only be averted if not only the trend tends to be increased again, but also the old levels are reached again. Not to mention the much more dramatic scenario of a second corona wave. If the earnings generated remain below this for a longer period of time, a simple calculation is enough to imagine that companies will soon begin to massively cut back on the (currently short-time) workforces that were designed for the old business levels. Even more dangerous: then, due to the sheer sham boom signals, Germany's hitherto zealous economic policy makers are too late to react. And to recognize how urgent a second stimulus package could be. The dramatic thing about the corona crisis is not that for a few weeks the sales fell breathtaking in a percentage-mathematical-historical comparison. This could be compensated for relatively relatively lightly with reserves and stimulus packages and short-time work subsidies (without talking down the drama for many). The real crisis threatens if it is not possible to quickly return to pre-crisis business. A few arithmetically impressive growth rates of a low level are not enough. If the corona shocks of the past few weeks are even partly responsible for Karstadt-Kaufhof closing dozens of department stores, putting thousands on the streets and thereby also threatening to accelerate the desolation of city centers, that's an alarm signal. Just like the announcements by several other corporations to cut jobs due to Corona. Or like the rumbling of one or the other politician or lobbyist, one has to start cutting back on debt reduction now. All of this threatens to turn the shock crisis into the real crisis. And then the economy threatens to weaken for years - and the unemployment statistics in particular would be record-breaking. It will be difficult to tell from the hip economic data of the coming weeks whether this will happen. Those who tend to react neurotically to excessive fluctuations in the Ifo business climate index should better not read any economic news for a few weeks. That doesn't work anyway. Have a beautiful holiday.\n",

            " With the start of holidays in several federal states, it became crowded in German seaside resorts. The beaches were swarming with sun-hungry people. Whoever wanted to get a beach chair in the popular places on the Bay of Lübeck usually stood in front of the sign: \"Occupied\". The summer holidays have already started in Hamburg, Berlin, Brandenburg and Mecklenburg-West Pomerania. It also starts in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia. The first big wave of travel in summer is expected, the ADAC anticipates long traffic jams on the motorways. A lot of traffic can be expected, especially on the classic tourist routes A3, A7, A8 and A9, a spokeswoman said on Friday. Traffic jams would also be expected on the A1 and A7 northbound. \"In addition, there are currently around 750 construction sites.\" On Friday it was already jammed on the highways in the north. There was a lot of traffic on the A1 towards Lübeck and on the A7 near Hamburg. Because of the corona crisis, more Germans are going on vacation in their own country than usual this year. In order to prevent too much crowding on the beaches, the Baltic Sea resorts of Scharbeutz, Sierksdorf, Neustadt, Pelzerhaken and Rettin, for example, have developed a website on which daytime tourists should soon be able to find out about the space available on the beaches. In addition, the beach chairs have to be spaced 3.25 meters apart, which in some cases means that not so many beach chairs can be rented. He now has about 30 percent fewer beach chairs, says landlord Peter Voß in Timmendorfer Strand. Beach chair lessor Katja König, on the other hand, was able to create additional space: \"I always had a playground area, which I have given up now.\" Schleswig-Holstein's Prime Minister Daniel Günther got an idea of ​​the situation in Timmendorfer Strand. \"From a distance, the beach looks very crowded, but if you look closer, you can see that the majority of people keep the necessary distances,\" said the CDU politician. The weather is now likely to get worse. \"It will be more volatile again, even with thunderstorms, before the temperatures rise again,\" said the German Weather Service about expectations from the weekend to the middle of the week. This could be an indication of an upcoming \"swing summer\", in which short heat phases alternate with inconsistent summer days. The holiday resorts on the North and Baltic Seas consistently report a very good booking situation. \"With us, the quarters are almost fully booked. The pre-bookings for summer 2020 were already very good even before the corona pandemic, so that only a few short-term travelers were added,\" said the spokeswoman for Tourism Service Grömitz, Jacqueline Felsmann. Many of the beds on the North Sea coast are also fully booked. \"We have probably had the strongest June in recent years, and in the coming week we will leave the 90 percent mark in occupancy and occupancy behind,\" said Olaf Raffel from Büsumer Tourismus Marketing Service TMS. The beaches also fill in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. \"It is already quite full, but now the most intense times are coming,\" said the managing director of the state tourism association, Tobias Woitendorf. During the summer vacation season in Germany until mid-September, he expects around four million overnight guests in the country. In Lower Saxony, the tourism association warned guests and hosts against too much relaxation. \"If distance or hygiene rules are not complied with, then we get a bang,\" said the chairman of the Lower Saxony Tourist Association, Sven Ambrosy. The worst thing that could happen to the tourism industry would be a corona lockdown due to increased infection rates.\n",

            " The Zanzibar and Sylt - this is a special symbiosis. Herbert Seckler's beach bar would never have been this big without the dunes and flair of the North Sea island. And the Swabian chef has been using the former beach kiosk for decades to help Sylt live up to its reputation as a casual luxury island. He drives to his restaurant every day, even in the corona crisis, in which he belongs to the risk group. Or, as the 68-year-old himself says: \"Target group number one with an asterisk\". He moved his \"office\" outside onto the terrace. \"I feel relatively safe here,\" he says. The lockdown was economically a catastrophe, the season was really bad. But: \"If you subtract the economic aspect, it was a great time,\" says Seckerl. \"You see things that you normally don't see. Now you only see people and bicycles and bicycles and bicycles.\" The island he came to 43 years ago still seems to love him. \"You can't explain Sylt. You can feel it or not.\" The Zanzibar is now operating again, waiters are rotating with masks to serve the guests, but also to collect the notes with the contact details. Sylt is also full again. In the past few weeks there had been trouble with people who refused to abide by the restrictions. At Pentecost, numerous celebrants gathered on the beach section \"Buhne 16\" in Kampen, a few kilometers north of Zanzibar in Rantum. Despite distance rules and the ban on day visitors on the island, more people came together than was actually allowed. \"Pentecost was questionable in some places,\" says Zanzibar host Seckler. He is annoyed that \"they are risking my life\".\n",

One of those houses that are not home. Just an accommodation. Like so many around here. A place to sleep until the next shift, until the next bone job. And now a prison. The steel gate to the courtyard is locked, no one is allowed out. The Romanians who live here, behind gray shutters and barred basement windows, are in quarantine. You work in Rheda-Wiedenbrück, in the largest German meat factory, at Tönnies. Poor pigs that disassemble poor pigs. A couple of men are lying on blankets outside on Tuesday this week drinking beer against boredom, uselessness and worry. How should it go on now? There were 15 men in the house, says one who calls himself George, five are infected. \"Three were picked up and taken to other pensions, two are still here.\" How do you do that under one roof? \"Yes, we're afraid to get infected,\" says George. \"I called the police who came and said we can't help you.\" So now they would have isolated the two infected, each in a room. It was last tested four days ago. No idea if he was positive, he was still waiting for the result, said George. If the men are not in quarantine, if they work how they are supposed to work, then they and the other contract workers cut tens of thousands of pigs a day. That's what they're here for, just for that. They are first class tools of the meat industry, but are treated like second class people. Hired by subcontractors, poorly paid, quickly replaced, poorly protected. Even in Corona times. In the past few weeks, says George, a fever monitor has been set up in the slaughterhouse, right next to the entrance. But no one there who would have served it. Every morning they \"just ran past it\". The motto seemed to be no accident. It was only two days before everyone had to be quarantined when it was clear that the largest outbreak of corona since the lockdown was brewing all over Europe at Tönnies, the company had taken employees to fever measurement. \"It was already too late,\" says George.

            " The number of known new infections in the USA rises to a record high, according to data from the Reuters news agency. According to their own censuses, at least 39,818 new cases were registered on Thursday. The previous high on April 24 was 36,426. This week, the states of Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Idaho, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Wyoming reported record increases. The Washington Post also reports a new high, which it reports with 39,327 cases. The newspaper relies on information from the health authorities of the individual states. At Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, there is currently no information about new infections in the past 24 hours. With the escalating numbers, the White House Corona Task Force will reappear. In the past few months, the panel of experts that President Donald Trump is supposed to advise has sometimes appeared daily. In the end, however, there had been no briefings for weeks, while President Trump was calling for the end of the crisis and the easing of anti-virus measures. Trump's Vice Mike Pence is to head the appointment on Friday. The United States is now carrying out significantly more tests than a few months ago, President Trump recently repeated as an explanation for the high number of cases. \"If we didn't test, we wouldn't have any cases,\" he repeated in an interview on Fox News on Thursday evening (local time). However, the increasing number of hospital admissions is an indicator that the situation is getting worse again. Experts such as the leading US immunologist Anthony Fauci are particularly concerned about the development in Florida, Texas and Arizona. Most recently, the US broadcaster NBC News reported that the government in Washington plans to stop funding federal funds for 13 test sites by the end of June. Seven test sites in Texas are affected. This does not mean the end of government support, but Washington wants to help the testing in other ways, the broadcaster said, citing the US Department of Health. The plans didn't mean less testing, it said. Trump is promoting a rapid reopening of the economy. He also wants to return to normal as quickly as possible, also with a view to the November election. According to him, the corona virus is gradually disappearing from the United States. The data doesn't support that. Texas Governor Greg Abbott only announced Thursday that steps to reopen the state would be suspended due to the dramatically increasing number of cases. Abbott, like Trump, belongs to the Republican Party. Similar plans exist in New Mexico, as CNN reports. With more than 2.3 million known corona infections, the United States has more documented cases than any other country in the world. More than 121,000 people died from Covid 19 disease.\n",

The company, which has shaped the hi-fi industry with its networked speakers, will shortly launch a new operating system for its products - at least for the younger ones. Sonos has developed a new version of its control app for this purpose and has also launched its first TV soundbar that can produce TV sound with Dolby Atmos technology. It is currently the gold standard for spatial sound. Arc is the name of this soundbar, which has been named after the shape of its cross-section and is to replace two products: the Playbar introduced in 2013 and the flat Playbase from 2017. Both are no longer up-to-date because they are too small for the TV sets would be bought today. With a width of 114 centimeters, the new Arc would fit much better with TVs in the 56-inch format and larger. That may well be true. Before my 49 inch TV, bought almost three and a half years ago, it just fits. Sonos filled the space won with additional speakers. While nine of them provided the soundscape in the playbar, there were a total of eleven in the arc, each driven by its own digital amplifier. The lavish equipment is necessary, among other things, to be able to produce Dolby Atmos sound, which can ensure, for example, that you can hear spaceships flying over you in \"Star Wars\". Viewed from the side, you can see the arcuate cross-section, the Arc, from which the new Sonos soundbar takes its name. For the first hearing test, I just let the new soundbar play music. After all, such a soundbar has a dual function, as a TV speaker and stereo system. This applies particularly to Sonos, because everything can be controlled via the app and speakers can play the same music synchronously in several rooms. The new version of the Sonos app, which is due to be released on June 8th, goes one step further by letting rooms be grouped together. \"Kitchen\", living room \"and\" dining room \"can be assigned to the ground floor group,\" bedroom \",\" bathroom \"and\" office \"to the upper floor. Sonos also promises with the new app that high-resolution audio formats such as Dolby Atmos, support for playing music. To do this, you have to find and subscribe to a streaming service that offers something like that. And you need comparatively new Sonos hardware, because some older speakers and amplifiers are not supported by the new app. They stay from now on relying on the old version of the app and will no longer benefit from new services or functions in the future. For this test I used a prerelease version of the new app. After installation, I first tried the Arc in stereo mode, just to listen to music Two things are particularly striking: The soundbar produces an enormously clear sound that also lets you hear fine details in songs. In \"Subterranean Homesick Alien\" vo n Radiohead, for example, the slightly sticky sound of the bass drum comes across very nicely. The stereo image seems a bit narrow to me, especially when you move away from the arc. Of course, the sound on television is much more important in a soundbar. Finally, Sonos promises \"incredibly realistic Dolby Atmos sound\" for the Arc. In fact, when I started the first film with Atmos soundtrack - there are a few on Apple TV, Disney + and Netflix - I notice a difference to my seven-year-old soundbar. What comes out of the eleven speakers sounds more spacious and brilliant. If you don't have the right TV, the highest of feelings: Dolby Digital 5.1 instead of Dolby Atmos Matthias Kremp / DER SPIEGEL But it doesn't sound as transparent and space-filling as Sennheiser's Ambeo soundbar, which I tested a few months ago. However, it costs almost three times as much. What I lack is the promised impression that I could also hear things that are happening above and behind me. But no matter what film I watch, there is nothing to hear about it. A look at the Sonos app then brings the disillusionment: It's not Dolby Atmos that the Arc is playing for me, but just Dolby Digital 5.1. In fact, all attempts to get Dolby Atmos up and running with the Arc fail. After several test runs with AppleTV and Fire TV Cube as a player, a phone call with a support expert from Sonos finally provides some clarification: The Arc can play Atmos sound, but my three and a half year old TV is too old for that. The problem: In order to make the installation as easy as possible - and maybe save a few dollars - Sonos the Arc only installed one HDMI socket, two or three are common. Because with most other sound bars with Dolby Atmos, you first connect the source device, for example a Blu-ray player or an Apple TV, to the sound bar via HDMI and then the TV with another HDMI cable to the sound bar. So the sound signal comes directly to the soundbar and the television only receives the image data. Makes the installation a bit easier, but limits the possibilities: The Sonos Arc has only one HDMI socket With the Arc, on the other hand, the opposite is true: the streaming box is first connected to the TV and the sound signal from there to the only HDMI socket on the Passed through soundbar. Including Dolby Atmos, this only works reliably with current TV sets with a so-called eArc HDMI socket. For Samsung and Sony this is the case for devices from the year of construction 2018, according to the Sonos support, whoever has a LG TV can also be lucky from the year of construction 2017. My Samsung model from the end of 2016 is now out. According to Sonos, no additional HDMI sockets have been installed to make installation as easy as possible. Pro Transparent Sound Easy installation and operation Integration in the Sonos multi-room system Contra Dolby Atmos only on new TVs High price With the Arc, Sonos has actually developed a great successor for the now somewhat old-fashioned playbar. The design is great, the sound wonderfully transparent, installation and operation are super simple, as you know it from Sonos. The restriction that you can only enjoy Dolby Atmos with it if you have a comparatively new television, however, unnecessarily limits the customer base. With a second HDMI jack that might cost a few dollars more, Sonos could have avoided this problem. Because of this limitation, it is not only hardly recommendable for owners of older TV sets, but also too expensive at 899 euros. At this price, companies such as LG, Samsung and Sony provide sound bars including subwoofers, which, thanks to several HDMI sockets, also deliver Dolby Atmos to such TVs. We decide which products we report in the network world and which we test or not. We do not receive any money or other consideration from the manufacturer for any of the test reports. For various reasons, we may not report on products even though we have corresponding test products.

            " In the investigation into Madeleine McCann, who disappeared in Portugal in 2007, the Kiel lawyer Friedrich Fülscher criticizes the Braunschweig public prosecutor's office. Christian B., who was suspected in the case, was \"in the pillory worldwide\". Although the public prosecutor's office did not make the name of the accused public, he was \"easily identifiable from the very individualized information\". It was no coincidence that the public prosecutor's office went public at that time. Among other things, B., who has been convicted several times, has applied for early release. He could not confirm the picture that Christian B.'s media paint. Read the entire interview here: SPIEGEL: Mr. Fülscher, your client Christian B. is suspected of kidnapping and murdering three-year-old Madeleine McCann in 2007. Does he admit the deed? Fülscher: There has never been an official interrogation offer. As a precaution, we have informed the public prosecutor that Christian B. will only - if at all - comment on the allegations.

            " The Germans are considered a cautious people. Every German citizen spends an average of more than 2,000 euros a year on insurance. But consumer advocates warn: Many people take out wrong insurance. Important risks are often not covered, but other aspects are completely overinsured. In order to find out what is really necessary, you should be aware of the risks in individual cases and whether you could cover them without insurance. You can only rely to a limited extent on the advice of insurance representatives. Finally, the seller receives a commission for every contract. This gives him an incentive to recommend his clients more than fewer policies. A simple rule is therefore important: Risks that mean total financial loss should be hedged. This includes, for example, liability damage caused to other people or third-party property - for example, the leaked washing machine that floods the entire apartment building or the injured pedestrian who was pushed onto the street by the cyclist. The amount of damage is theoretically unlimited here - insurance is therefore very useful. However, in the case of risks with potentially limited damage - such as on your own car and apartment - you should consider whether you could not pay the necessary amount yourself in the event of damage. If so, you can often save yourself the insurance premium. You can find an overview of which insurance is useful for whom here:\n",

            " André M. sits completely calm on the dock. He opened a laptop in front of him. Every now and then he taps something into the computer. The 32-year-old is pale, underweight and dressed entirely in black. He is silent in court. And yet his voice can be heard in the courtroom for hours. The 10th Grand Criminal Court of the Berlin Regional Court has him play countless voice messages. The content is disturbing. André M. talks about fantasies of killing, his enthusiasm for killing spree, that he despises people and feels no pity. It sounds like a psychopath's self-portrait. The man from Halstenbek in Schleswig-Holstein is said to have sent dozens of threatening emails under the pseudonym \"National Socialist Offensive\". In it, the sender threatens with explosive attacks and murder. André M. sent the voice messages, which were played in court on Thursday and Friday, to a young woman in autumn 2018. The two got to know each other through a kind of internet self-help group for people with mental health problems. He enjoys sharing with her. This shows the flood of messages he sends her via WhatsApp, often several times a day. André M. has spent several years in prison and in forensic psychiatry. An expert had diagnosed him with psychopathy, a severe form of dissocial personality disorder, he tells the woman. The diagnosis seems to flatter him. He explains her the psychopathic art of manipulation. He sent her the opinion of an expert, who asked whether he could be released from law enforcement in May 2013. He summarizes the content: There he was described as \"downright bad\", \"and that I shouldn't be let out\". Five months later, the next statement suddenly said that his release had to be prepared. \"It also has to do with manipulation,\" he says. He had duped them all. \"It is child's play to fool them.\" At least for him, who \"can easily manipulate the entire level of control\", psychologists, psychiatrists, even the chief physician. He also says: \"It would be child's play to manipulate you, to destroy you mentally.\" He asserts: \"I definitely don't do that with you.\" Then to explain to her - \"from a psychopathic point of view\" - how he could use what she entrusted to him to harm her. \"It is not meant to be angry.\" He wants to impress her with his knowledge, that's how it works. With knowledge in very special areas. He lectures on psychiatric drugs, lectures on explosives, which weapon license you need for which weapon and how you can get it. He also describes her the way to the hidden part of the Internet, the so-called Darknet, and to a forum, \"a marketplace like Amazon\", where she can buy drugs and weapons. \"You can get everything there.\" He tries to get her to communicate with him in encrypted form, \"the cops can't keep up with it\". But the woman doesn't want to. \"It is too expensive for me to write encrypted messages,\" she says: \"I don't feel like it.\" André M. continues to send her WhatsApp messages - and now hears himself speak in court. For example, how to send the bomb anonymously to the police. Gradually André M. becomes clearer in his news. He asks how she would react if he attacked him. She asks back: \"If you would do something?\" \"Well, killing spree, bombing,\" he says. She didn't understand his question about her reaction, instead she says: \"I could imagine that you would do something like that, yes.\" But only if he could prevent him from going to jail again. \"That's the hard part,\" she says. The fact that she does not react frightened seems to encourage André M. to reveal more and more to her. He tells her about his fantasies that his thoughts were about killing. \"I still have an urge to kill others and myself,\" he says. \"These are thoughts that I actually have every day.\" He has \"a very profound aversion to people in general\" and feels \"zero pity\". \"I don't mind if other people suffer.\" He sees his \"emotional numbness\", as he calls it himself, in his childhood. When he was eight years old, a heart defect was discovered in him. He spent months in the hospital. \"That's where I got my detsch for life.\" Detsch is northern German and means Macke. Because of his heart disease, he had to stop doing everything he loved. He was no longer allowed to play football, to do karate, no \"high-performance gymnastics\". He was only allowed to leave the house when accompanied by an adult. Even at school there had to be a teacher with him. He says: \"If you forbid everything to a child, the child becomes depressed.\" At nine, he made his first attempt at suicide. At ten he had become \"extremely aggressive\". He tells how he tortured his classmates. All in one tone, like he was listing his hobbies. At 16, he shot a group of young people with a revolver. The ball had flown over their heads. He never met the woman he tells all of this about. There was never a meeting. Instead, there is a suspicion that it was André M. who, under the name \"National Socialist Offensive\", also sent e-mails threatening to kill her.\n",

He had boarded the port city of Kaffa on the Black Sea and traveled west on Genoese ships, first to Sicily, then to Genoa and Venice. When the galleys moored to the quay wall of the Venetian port in February or March 1348, nobody suspected anything of the life-threatening cargo. In the previous year, a plague had hit Constantinople and almost all the port cities of the eastern Mediterranean, where people got dark, purulent bumps in the groin, behind the ears or in the armpits and were shaken by fever. They suffered a hellish headache, were excruciatingly dull, and died in rows. Digital edition Order online now and the booklet will be sent to your home! Order from Amazon.

            " The Stuttgart police arm themselves against renewed riots this weekend in the city center. The background is, among other things, attempts to mobilize on the Internet. \"There have been isolated calls for violence on various social channels in the past few days,\" police spokeswoman Monika Ackermann confirmed on request. The calls should be taken seriously. There is neither a special grouping nor recognizable political motives behind it. In the past few days, a representative of the Stuttgart police had warned in an internal round about calls to \"Bambule\" online. \"We will noticeably increase the police presence,\" said Ackermann about the preparations for the weekend. The officials should focus primarily on dialogue. \"We will be on the road at Eckensee with several communication teams at an early stage and try to assess the mood of those present there,\" said Ackermann. The riots started last weekend from Eckensee in downtown Stuttgart.\n",

            " Headsets for telephone workers usually have a microphone that is placed close to the mouth on a thin arm to ensure the best possible voice recording. The design is tried and tested and good. But if you are looking for a headset for at home, you want more than just good voice quality. The all-round headphones should connect to a PC and smartphone at the same time, listen to music and watch films deliver good sound and have built-in microphones for making calls. Ideally, it also lowers the noise level of children playing. Active noise cancellation, also called ANC (Active Noise Cancellation), quickly reaches its limits. Above all, it can block out even, low frequencies, such as those produced by aircraft engines. Passive noise suppression in the form of soft ear pads helps better against the high frequencies that children play, for example. The products recommended here were selected subjectively, but independently of the editorial team. Via the so-called affiliate links in the text, the publisher, but never the author individually, receives a small commission from the dealer for sales. I tried six headsets from Bose, Jabra, Poly (formerly Plantronics) and Microsoft that all meet these requirements, but in very different ways. A living room with a 5.1 surround system was used as the test environment, from which a recording from a busy kindergarten was played at 50 percent volume. You hardly understand your own word anymore. All headsets can be paired with up to eight end devices via Bluetooth and automatically connect to the last two. The Poly Voyager Focus UC and the new Jabra Evolve2 65 are specially designed for making calls. You only have a very gentle noise suppression by ear pads on the ears, which is supported by ANC in the focus. When listening to music, both lower the noise level, but the children's voices remain clearly recognizable unless the music is turned up loud. With a Skype call, however, the background noise disappears almost completely. Price inquiry time June 26th, 2020 11:29 pm No guarantee With Evolve2 your own voice is transmitted crystal clear, the Voyager sounds a bit more artificial. Both headsets can be comfortably worn for hours. Music is also not neglected, the sound of the Jabra can be adjusted using a smartphone app. For the radio link to the PC or Mac, Evolve2 and Focus UC use tiny USB adapters with a theoretical range of 30 meters switch. The Focus's microphone boom can be turned in both directions and can therefore be worn on the left or right. The Focus knows via a sensor whether it is sitting on the ears. Pickup answers a call, mutes it, or pauses playback. The other four headsets need no microphone arm and use four or more built-in microphones to locate the user's voice. Thick ear cushions surround the auricles and lie directly on the head. Passive noise cancellation is therefore very effective if the fit is right. But that can also lead to hot ears. So that you can still hear your own voice, all four insert the user's voice into your own ear cups when you are on the phone. You can control how loud you hear yourself using the app. If you want to hear your surroundings, all four headsets can switch to acoustic swipe. The sound picked up by the external microphones is then simply passed through to the inside. Microsoft's Surface Headphones have by far the most elegant controls. A wheel on the right ear cup adjusts the volume, on the left the noise suppression in 13 steps from pulling through to full attenuation. It feels completely natural. On the right you turn up the music, on the left the ambient noise. With two hands you can quickly set exactly what you want without thinking. Both ear cups have a touch control panel, with which you can take calls left or right as you like or control the music playback. Price inquiry time June 26th, 2020 11:29 pm No guarantee The Poly Voyager 8200 UC is the grandfather in the test field. It also has the small USB adapter for connecting to a PC or Mac. You can choose between two ANC levels using a slide switch, and a button switches to swipe. The design with the imitation wood takes some getting used to, but that does not detract from the function. While the surface headphones weaken when playing music, the poly offers a full sound with crystal-clear highs. You want the missing equalizer to slow down the very prominent bass drum. If you like listening to electronic dance music, you will find the right companion here. Price inquiry time June 26th, 2020 11:29 pm No guarantee Jabra claims that the Elite 85h with its eight microphones would ensure particularly clear telephone intelligibility. It cannot take up this space in this test field. No other headset emits so much noise from the transmitter. It is the smartest headset in this group. It can switch between different sound profiles independently. In quiet environments, it turns the ANC off, when you're on the move, it switches to draft and when a loud bus drives past, the ANC pushes the noise away. This automatic system can be switched off so that profiles can also be changed at the touch of a button. The headset does not have a separate switch. You simply turn the ear cups to the rest position and it switches off. Price query time June 26th, 2020 11:29 pm No guarantee The Bose NC 700 was initially not intended for this comparison. The Bose headsets have earned a good reputation as headphones for frequent flyers and have outstanding active noise cancellation. To our great surprise, this also works exceptionally well when making calls. Due to its design, the NC 700 only has to give in to the two models with a microphone arm. In the sum of all properties it would be worth a recommendation if it did not have a horse's foot. If you want to configure the headset via the Bose app, this requires a personal registration, which goes hand in hand with a very extensive data transmission. This is very unfortunate, because otherwise this app is very well suited to manage Bluetooth connections and adjust the sound. Price inquiry time June 26th, 2020 11:29 pm No guarantee All six headsets are well suited for telephone calls and video conferences. The operation hardly puzzles and works perfectly for everyone. In terms of speech intelligibility, the ranking is: Evolve2 65, Voyager Focus, NC 700, Voyager 8200, Surface, Elite 85h. The NC700 is far ahead in terms of noise suppression, followed by the Elite 85h, Voyager 8200, Surface, Voyager Focus and Evolve2 65. In terms of sound, the four over-ears beat the two on-ears, with slight advantages for the NC 700 and Voyager 8200.\n",

The heavyweight world champion was never as helpless and without ideas as on this June 26, 1976. He has not landed a blow in several laps, his red gloves dangle dormantly while the Champ's nimble legs try to avoid the kicks. The booing and whistles get louder, cups and crumpled programs land in the ring. Meanwhile, the hematoma on Ali's leg is blooming, the ground attacks of the Japanese giant have an effect. All observers agree: the world has never seen a miserable struggle. How the hell was the greatest boxer ever got in there? Almost two years earlier, Ali is at the height of his career. At the legendary \"Rumble in the Jungle\" 1974 he recaptured the world championship title against the muscle mountain George Foreman. But the forced break from 1967 to 1971, which resulted from his iconic conscientious objection to military service (\"I ain't got no quarrel with them Vietcong!\"), Cost Ali not only the best years of his athletic life, but also a lot of money.

            " The risk of dying from coronavirus infection is very low in children and adolescents. In the vast majority of those infected, Covid-19 takes a mild course, as confirmed by a large Europe-wide study. Most developed fever and upper respiratory complaints. For the investigation, a team of researchers evaluated data from 82 medical facilities in 25 European countries during the first high point of the corona pandemic. Their study included information from 582 children between the ages of three days and 18 years who were all diagnosed with Sars-Cov-2 and whose parents sought medical help with them. 16 percent of the children developed no symptoms at all, most of them were only tested because close contacts were infected. 62 percent of the study participants had to be treated in the hospital. Eight percent needed treatment in the intensive care unit. The risk of this increased if the children were infected with more than one respiratory virus and their immune system had to fight a cold or flu virus at about the same time. The vast majority of children (87 percent) recovered without the need for additional oxygen or artificial ventilation. However, four of the more than 500 children died, two of them had previous illnesses, as the researchers report in the journal \"The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health\". The mortality rate in the group was below one percent. In fact, the risk of developing a serious illness is likely to be significantly lower than the numbers suggest. Since the study only evaluated data from children whose parents had received medical help, many very mild cases were probably not recorded at all. \"Our study provides the most comprehensive overview of Covid-19 in children and adolescents to date,\" said Marc Tebruegge of the UCL Great Ormond Street Institute for Child Health in London. \"It was comforting to see that the mortality rate in our study group was very low and is likely to be significantly lower since many children with mild illnesses were not brought to medical treatment and were therefore not included in this study.\" Nevertheless, serious illnesses that require treatment in the intensive care unit could also occur in a not inconsiderable number of children, said Tebruegge. \"This should be taken into account when planning and prioritizing health resources during the pandemic.\" The results of the Europe-wide study coincide with other studies that have been published in the past weeks. According to this, children only get sick occasionally after an infection. Very rarely, however, there can also be a severe course of the disease with severe inflammatory reactions. In addition, an increasing number of studies indicate that children are less likely to get the coronavirus than adults. For a recent study, researchers had examined a large part of the residents of Ischgl for antibodies against the coronavirus. The virus had spread rapidly in the holiday resort in early March. In fact, the researchers discovered antibodies to the virus in more than 40 percent of the population, which are a sure sign that they have gone through the infection. However, children were affected much less often, even if Corona cases had occurred in their families. A Dutch study with targeted tests in families of infected people came to the same result. Why children are probably better protected from the virus has not yet been fully clarified. One reason could be that they are better shielded, so they have fewer contacts. But it is also quite possible that your immune system can fight off the virus better.\n",

            " The corona pandemic is also plunging the German economy into a crisis. Many companies are already feeling it. In order not to have to dismiss their employees, they now send them in short-time work. Employees then receive money from unemployment insurance - in principle also at this level: 60 percent of the net wage, employees with children in the household 67 percent. However, not every employee is fully committed to short-time work. It is possible (and also customary) that short-time workers still work part of the agreed working hours. You will then continue to receive a corresponding share of the wages from the employer. In the event of loss of earnings, they then receive short-time work benefits - 60 or 67 percent of the amount that they lack for their normal net wages. How much that is concrete is difficult to calculate depending on the case. With our short-time work allowance calculator, you can quickly and easily calculate how much income you can expect in your specific case. In order to be able to use the calculator, you must first enter your regular gross monthly salary (in the \"Gross gross wage target\" field), then the gross monthly salary that you also receive from your employer during short-time work (in the \"Gross gross wage actual\" field) . If you work with so-called short-time work, zero - so don't work at all anymore - your actual gross salary will also be zero euros. If your working time is halved, your actual gross salary will also be halved. You also have to specify whether children live in your household - and which state you live in. The latter is necessary because different contribution limits apply to East and West Germany. If your gross salary with short-time work is still above this limit, no short-time work benefit will be paid. Then you need to know your income tax class. Here is a brief overview of which class you belong to: Income tax class I applies to the following employees: single widows from the year after next after the death of their spouse or registered partner, divorced married or living in a partnership who are permanently separated or married whose spouse or registered partner is only subject to limited taxation in the Federal Republic (usually because he or she does not live in Germany) Wage tax class II applies to single parents who meet the requirements of tax class I and who are also entitled to the relief amount for single parents to have. The following employees fall into income tax class III: Married and registered partners who do not live separately forever and have not chosen tax class IV. The spouse or life partner who is also employed then receives tax class V. If the other partner is not employed or self-employed, wage tax class III also applies to him. Widowed until the end of the calendar year following the death of the spouse / partner. The deceased spouse or life partner must have been subject to unlimited income tax at the time of his death. The spouses or life partners must not have lived separately until the time of death. Married employees or those living in partnership fall into income tax class IV if both partners are subject to unlimited income tax and do not permanently live separately. However, if one partner is in tax class III, the other does not fall in tax class IV, but in tax class V. Spouses or life partners who are both employed can have the tax class changed once a year. Tax class V is applied if both spouses or life partners apply to classify the other spouse or life partner in tax class III (see above). Income tax class VI is usually entered if an employee has more than one employment relationship.\n",

            " The salary for the new job sounds good. But how much money is left of it? Which tax bracket is the cheapest if both spouses work? And how does a child allowance affect? All of these questions can be answered with the gross-net calculator. Simply enter your gross wages and allowances, choose tax class, state and health insurance. If you have children, please indicate possible child allowances. The more information you provide, the more accurate the result. To be able to use the calculator, you must first know your income tax class. Here is a brief overview of which class you belong to. Income tax class I applies to the following employees: -Ledige-widowed persons from the year after next after the death of the spouse or registered partner, divorced-married or living in a partnership who are permanently separated-married or living in partnership, their spouse or registered partner is subject to limited taxation in the Federal Republic (usually because he or she does not live in Germany) Wage tax class II applies to single parents who meet the requirements of tax class I and who are also entitled to the relief amount for single parents. Wage tax class III includes the following employees: -Married and registered life partners who do not permanently live separately and have not chosen tax class IV. The spouse or life partner who is also employed then receives tax class V. If the other partner is not employed or self-employed, he is also subject to income tax class III widowed until the end of the calendar year following the death of the spouse / life partner. The deceased spouse or life partner must have been subject to unlimited income tax at the time of his death. The spouses or life partners must not have lived separately until the time of death. Married employees or those living in partnership fall into income tax class IV if both partners are subject to unlimited income tax and do not permanently live separately. However, if one partner is in tax class III, the other does not fall in tax class IV, but in tax class V. Spouses or life partners who are both employed can have the tax class changed once a year. Salary negotiations: Seven golden rules Tax class V is applied when both spouses or life partners apply to classify the other spouse or life partner in tax class III (see above). Income tax class VI is usually entered if an employee has more than one employment relationship . How do your finances change when you change your life? With the help of this calculator you can quickly and easily find out, for example, how a job change or a salary increase will affect your net salary. This way you can avoid surprises when you actually have the first new pay slip in your hands. Other changes in life can also be tapped for their financial impact with the help of the calculator. They want to marry? Then you and your partner have to think about which tax classes you want to work in: either one in III or the other in V or both in IV. Tax class IV is recommended for both partners if both earn similar amounts. Otherwise the combination of III for one partner and V for the other. The tax classes differ only in how much tax is automatically deducted from the salary each month. Those who have paid too much will get the money back once a year after submitting their tax return. Are you expecting a child? Then, as a rule, their net salary increases through child allowances and a higher child benefit. Have you dropped faith? Then you can check whether the saved church tax can make up for the waiver of eternal salvation. Are you considering switching from statutory to private health insurance? If you know what contribution rate your new insurance will charge, you can use the calculator to check how this will change your net salary. However, you should never make the question of the right health insurance dependent solely on tax considerations. The potential tax savings are small compared to the huge costs that poorly chosen private health insurance entails over the years. You can find out which types of insurance generally make sense for you in our overview. The vast majority of tax savings opportunities are only available to those who also submit a tax return. This can be quite a challenge, especially for young workers. You can find help here.\n",

            " In iOS 14 and iPadOS 14 there is an option under Settings / Privacy / Location Services for each app to determine whether it can use the exact location or only an approximate location. If you deny her the exact position, the operating system will give her a location within a radius of about 15 kilometers. This can be, for example, a town hall or another prominent point in the area. In the App Store, Apple wants to provide information about which user data an app uses and with whom it shares them. That sounds good, but it has a sticking point: the information in the store is based on messages from the respective app provider. These reports are mandatory for the providers and should be verified through a combination of automatic and manual checks. Apps from developers that do not provide any or incorrect information about tracking fly out of the offer. In addition, users of each newly installed app must explicitly allow tracking. Apple's browser has long shown in its list of passwords when a password is too easy to guess or is used on multiple websites. In the future, Safari should also inform its users if their passwords have appeared in a leak. The company has not yet revealed the sources from which the Group obtains the information it needs. Offers such as Have i been pwned and the Identity Leak Checker from the Hasso Plattner Institute have been collecting such information for a long time and could provide help here. With iOS 14, Apple is introducing a function that warns the user when an app reads the clipboard, i.e. the digital clipboard of the operating system. What you cut out of a text or image using the \"Copy\" command ends up in the clipboard. Some users of the beta version noticed that the new warning message pops up whenever you type in the TikTok app. At this point you will find external content from Twitter that complements the article. You can show it with a click and hide it again.\n",

            " According to TikTok, this behavior was a reaction of the new system to a function of the app that is supposed to recognize repeated entries by spammers. An update for TikTok that eliminates this behavior is already available. TikTok was not an isolated case. For example, we were able to reproduce the warning message in Microsoft Teams. Above all to avoid possible competition complaints, Apple wants to offer users of iOS 14 and iPadOS 14 the possibility to set third-party apps as the standard browser and mail program. Of course, this only works if the respective developers have adapted their apps to the new option. Only when such an app is installed will the corresponding option appear in the settings. At least with the browsers, this option means only a little bit of freedom. Because no matter whether Chrome, Edge or Firefox: Under iOS, web browsers must always use the WebKit software on which Safari is based. Ultimately, this makes them all sisters and brothers of Safari, who only differ in their appearance and the possibility of synchronizing bookmarks and the like with other services. Running Windows on a Mac parallel to macOS will be more difficult in the future. As long as Apple was using Intel processors, it was easy to install Microsoft's Windows on top of Apple's macOS. With Boot Camp there was even an Apple software that made this possible. The switch to Apple chips ends this cozy togetherness. Virtualization programs such as those from vmware and Parallels will no longer be able to run Windows or Linux on Apple's computers. At least not until they have been completely rewritten for the new chips. And even then, Windows-on-Mac should no longer be a serious option. The translation of Intel processor instructions to Apple technology will drastically slow down such programs. It remains to be seen whether the Windows version Windows 10 on ARM developed by Microsoft for so-called ARM processors will eventually run on Apple's computers. So far, there are apparently no plans. In addition, Microsoft would have to be persuaded to offer this version of Windows over the counter. So far, Windows 10 on ARM has only been delivered to hardware manufacturers. Many fascinating innovations were shown at the WWDC keynote. What was not mentioned here: Many of the new functions will initially only be available in a few countries or they will only work with certain devices. You can plan bike tours in Apple Maps in the following cities: San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, New York City, Shanghai and Beijing. There are said to be a few more, but they have not yet been named. When and how quickly the offer will be expanded is unclear. The handwriting recognition on iPad called Scribble only works in English and Chinese. Translation via the Translate app speaks the following languages: Arabic, Chinese, German, English, French, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish. To be able to hear surround sound with AirPods Pro, you need an iPhone 7 or newer or a relatively recent iPad. One more reason not to install iOS 14 on the iPhone that is used in everyday life: The software interface required for the Corona warning app is not included, at least in the beta version now distributed to developers, which is why the app is on such iPhones currently not working. iOS 14 will run on all iPhones from the 6s and SE models, which corresponds to the year of construction 2015. MacOS Big Sur can be installed on the following Apple computers: MacBooks from 2015 MacBook Air from 2013 MacBook Pro from the end of 2013 Mac mini from 2014 iMac from 2014 iMac Pro from 2017 Mac Pro from 2013 The following Apple tablets are compatible with iPadOS 14 : iPad mini from 4th generation iPad Air from 2nd generation iPad from 5th generation All versions of the iPad Pro The new watchOS 7 requires at least one Apple Watch Series 3 as a basis. Registered developers can already download the first preliminary versions of the new Apple operating systems get on their devices. Participation in Apple's developer program is open to everyone, but costs 99 euros per year. Those who curb curiosity a bit can take part in Apple's public beta test program from July - when exactly, we don't know. That should also be the safer variant, because the versions that the group will then distribute should already have the grossest errors corrected. With such a test, you still have to face certain problems. The battery typically does not last as long as you are used to because the software has not yet been optimized for it in beta. Apple has roughly announced the final versions of the new operating systems for autumn. IOS 14 is available towards the end of September and beginning of October, watchOS 7 and macOS Big Sur are likely to follow a little later.\n",

            " The products recommended here were selected subjectively, but independently of the editorial team. Via the so-called affiliate links in the text, the publisher, but never the author individually, receives a small commission from the dealer for sales. Well, great, no music festivals, outdoor pools closed, barbecuing with friends prohibited, the vacation trip may also fall flat. In the year in which the corona virus determines our life, you have to bring that summer feeling into your home. So why not try out our own ice cream production and try your hand at gelating? My personal - admittedly exotic - favorites liquorice, peanut butter and rhubarb are not offered by every ice cream shop anyway. I ordered three different machines for test stirring and subsequent test licking, from very simple and simple to quite fancy and expensive. Brief presentation of the tested products Profi Cook PC-ICM 1140 - simple machine at an affordable price. Krups Perfect Mix 9000 Ice Cream Maker GVS241 - affordable machine with transparent lid. Severin 2-in-1 ice machine EZ 7405 - professional-looking machine with integrated cooling compressor. Here's how we tested: Practical test: All ice cream machines were filled with various ice cream mixes based on milk and water to determine how quickly they finished mixing the ice cream variants (measurement by stopwatch). The ease of use was taken into account. Volume: The operating noise was measured in decibels dB (A) from a meter away using a smartphone app. Unpacked Housing, ice bucket (dimensions: 19 x 14 cm, content: 1.8 liters), motor unit, cover, stirring shaft, stirring blade, locking ring. Operating instructions in ten languages ​​(including DE, EN, FR, RS, IT) Put on The assembly of the few components was simple, just plugging and unplugging the motor unit in the cover was a bit fiddly. The Profi Cook machine was the quietest with an operating noise of 55 dB. Handling The device was the most compact in the test field. The opaque lid turned out to be not very practical: During the first attempts, I worked in blind flight, since it is hardly possible to see the freezer container. So: switch off in between, open the lid, check the consistency of the ice, and if necessary put the lid back on, reset the time. This should become superfluous after some practice and practice. I helped myself by shining a flashlight into the opening. The device made a very robust impression, the components were made of plastic, partly coated with stainless steel. To make ice cream, the freezer container must first be frozen for at least twelve hours - making a spontaneous dessert is therefore not possible. And: the container does not fit into the freezer compartment of a small table fridge! After appropriate preparation, the Profi Cook machine made milk or water ice in about 15 minutes. If you like it firmer, just let the machine run longer. The container was big enough for six generous portions that have to be taken out quickly - otherwise the ice will be too hard. Conclusion The cheapest machine in the test was easy to use and quiet in operation. Their housing looks classy and makes cleaning easy. Pro: Favorable price - selectable operating time - quiet. Cons: poor insight into the freezer. Price query time June 26, 2020 11:21 pm No guarantee Unpacked Freezer container (dimensions: 21 x 13.4 cm, content: 1.6 liters), engine block, mixing arm, upper ring, lower ring, storage lid, ice scraper, operating instructions in ten languages ​​(including DE, EN , FR, RS, IT), recipe book (FR, DE, ENG, NL) The box promises to be \"short preparation time\", which of course makes you spontaneous. But like the Profi Cook, the freezer container had to be frozen, according to the manual, for at least 24 hours. Time enough to clean the other components and familiarize yourself with the manual. The operating noise of the Krups machine was 60 dB. Handling All parts were easy to assemble and click into place audibly. The filling opening for the ice cream was a bit narrow. Thanks to the transparent lid, it was easy to observe the degree of completion of the ice. A time could not be preset on the machine. I would recommend observing the ice cream production anyway: all tested ice creams were already spoon-proof after about 15 minutes, if you let the machine run longer, they became crumbly and were difficult to scrape out of the container. All parts were made of very robust plastic and fit together seamlessly. Everyday usability Like the Profi Cook machine, making the ice cream also had to be planned with the Krups. Operation was very simple and intuitive, the freezer container was large enough for four to six servings. After completion, the ice had to be removed quickly, otherwise it would become very hard. It was easy to dismantle and clean. Conclusion: The Krups Perfect Mix worked on the same principle as the Profi Cook, but looked better processed. Pro: Good workmanship - with a recipe book. Cons: No time delay. Price query time June 26th, 2020 11:21 pm No guarantee Unpacked ice machine (dimensions without lid: 42.5 x 23 x 28.5 cm), freezer container (dimensions: 16.5 x 14 cm, content: 1 liter), lid, stirrer arm, operating instructions in twelve Languages ​​(including DE, ENG, FR, NL, ES), recipe booklet (DE, ENG, FR), measuring cup, ice cream scoop on. Severin's ice cream machine was significantly larger than the other test candidates and weighed around 6 kg. It works differently than the smaller candidates: the Severin machine has an integrated cooling compressor - similar to a professional ice machine. If you turn it on after preparing and filling the ice cream, your cooling unit will drop to minus 30 degrees within four minutes. The machine is operated using a touch keypad on the top of the housing. She acknowledged inputs with a very loud and penetrating beep. The Severin's operating noise was 64 dB. Handling The operation of the Severin machine was significantly easier than with the other machines because it has its own cooling. The touch field responded to light finger pressure and was intuitive to use. Quality Large, heavy, stable. The Severin machine looked very well made and indestructible. It is not intended for professional ice cream production, but comes close to it. Everyday usability Make ice cream spontaneously without much preparation - with Severin it was possible. The rotating wing stirred six good portions of ice with slow movements to the right consistency within 20 to 25 minutes, and the transparent lid made it easy to control. Advantage compared to the small machines: After completion, the machine stops the compressor, the ice can therefore remain in the container for a while without freezing to stone hard. Conclusion: The large and heavy Severin machine cannot be bought to get it out of the closet once or twice a year. It is for real ice fanatics who use such a device regularly - and have enough space in the kitchen. Pro: Very good workmanship - quick to use - recipe booklet with unusual ice cream creations. Cons: Not for small kitchens - expensive - loud. Price inquiry time June 26th, 2020 11:21 pm No guarantee One thing is certain: All three ice machines have reliably produced ice. How it tastes ultimately depends on the recipes used, the ingredients and some practice. The affordable models differ mainly in terms of workmanship and ease of use and are completely sufficient for getting to know each other and for occasional ice cream making. The expensive Severin machine is more for hardcore ice cream fans: It takes up a lot of space, but is quickly ready for use without much preparation.\n",

            " In March the Dresden Higher Regional Court sentenced eight defendants of the extreme right-wing \"Revolution Chemnitz\" to long prison terms. Now the district court in Chemnitz has also sentenced six suspected supporters of the far-right terrorist group to prison terms. According to the guilty verdict, they are detained for between six months and a year. The Chemnitz district court sentenced the accused for breaching the peace. A probation was out of the question because the court was unwilling to spread fear again, the presiding judge justified the decision. According to the court, the men between the ages of 25 and 34 were involved in an attack on park visitors in Chemnitz in mid-September 2018. They had previously participated in a demonstration by the right-wing extremist association Pro Chemnitz. In the attack on refugees and a group of young people, they are said to have been armed with punch gloves and bottles. The verdict is not yet legally binding.

            " \"This card is racist,\" admitted manufacturer Wizards of the Coast in a statement on its website and continued: \"Racism in any form is not acceptable and has no justification in our games or anywhere else.\" In mid-June, the company, a subsidiary of the US toy manufacturer Hasbro, removed the \"Invoke Prejudice\" card and six other playing cards from its database. These include \"Crusade\", which gives \"white creatures\" a bonus, and \"Cleanse\", which \"destroys all black creatures\". The cards are no longer allowed at official tournaments, according to Wizards of the Coast. The pressure on the company had increased in recent weeks after black members of the \"Magic\" community in particular had publicly accused racist grievances in the scene and at the manufacturer. One of them is Lawrence Harmon, longtime podcaster, among others in the \"Magic\" scene. In an open letter he published in early June, he wrote that Wizards of the Coast \"ignores the existence of its black player base\". Harmon further criticized that both the manufacturer and a large part of the community made the black player feel \"not welcome\". In his letter, he classified the manufacturer's public messages on the subject of racism as \"half-hearted platitudes\". Harmon received support from Zaiem Beg, a former freelancer at Wizards of the Coast. Less than a week later, Beg also published an open letter accusing the company of a discriminatory corporate culture. He gives several anonymized examples of cases of inequality within the company that have happened to other Peoples of Color. Beg also criticizes the company's external image as a diverse employer. Management positions are still almost exclusively filled with white employees. The growing louder accusations of racism are not the only problem that Wizards of the Coast is currently facing. The company ended working with Noah Bradley on Monday, the artist who had designed cards for playing cards in Magic the Gathering. Bradley had previously been accused of sexual abuse by several women. Numerous users had reported on Twitter about their experiences with sexual abuse in the artist scene, some accused Bradley of sexual assault. The accused then admitted his actions in a tweet. \"Yeah, I was one of those crappy, creepy sexual predators you hear about,\" Bradley wrote, admitting he forced women to have sex.

            " Siegfried seems to grin as he swims. He raised his nostrils and bared his teeth - as if he had nothing but contempt for the dangerous situation. But that's a purely human perspective. Like all horses, he instinctively does this so that no water runs into his nostrils. Jan Mohnhaupt, born in 1983, is a freelance journalist and non-fiction author. His work \"The Zoo of Others\", published in 2017, on the animal arms race between the Federal Republic and the GDR has been translated into several languages. \"Animals in National Socialism\" (2020) is Mohnhaupt's third book. Siegfried is an approximately seven year old fox-colored Trakehner. His rider, the Dresdener Max Kuhnert, is a scout in the rider platoon of the 432nd Infantry Regiment, which was commanded on the banks of the Western Bug in June 1941. The river forms the border between the areas occupied by the Germans and those of the Soviet Union. Up to this point and no further, Adolf Hitler and Josef Stalin had agreed when they made their non-aggression pact in 1939. But on June 22, 1941, Hitler had the long-planned \"Barbarossa Company\" begin, the attack on the Soviet Union. Three million soldiers are ready, equipped with 1,800 aircraft, 3,600 tanks, 7,000 guns, 600,000 motor vehicles - and 750,000 horses. Regiment 432 is one of the first to cross the bow. Since the hastily erected pontoon bridge has long been under constant fire, Kuhnert has no choice but to swim over with Siegfried. Nazi propaganda tries to present the war of aggression as a motorized, high-tech undertaking. But the reality is different: there were horses on every front, whether in the west or east. But especially on the Eastern Front, there is no progress without horses. Because there are not enough motorized vehicles and fuel to bring weapons and provisions to the front as reliably and quickly as is possible with horses. A total of almost three million horses, donkeys and mules are sent to war on the German side. Never before and never again have animals played such a decisive role in German history as in the \"Third Reich\". They have been of importance in all areas of life, whether in war, everyday life or in propaganda. And the horse plays a special role in this. Because while the National Socialists like to compare themselves to wolves and give their tanks the names of big cats, it is the only herbivore, the only escape animal that is worshiped alongside all these predators. Hunted, revered, used: animals under National Socialism This is shown not least in the Nazi art, which is rich in horse motifs - be it long-legged mounts that carry their soldiers over all obstacles, or massive arable pillars that indifferently the floe at home plow up. In the Nazi iconography, the horse stands for strength and willingness to make sacrifices without appearing submissive. Even if Adolf Hitler is fond of dogs and worships the wolf, he can hardly get enough of horses. He had two of his larger-than-life horse statues in classic style created by one of his favorite sculptors, Josef Thorak, in the garden of the New Reich Chancellery in Berlin. But Hitler's hippophilia is limited to works of art. He avoids any direct contact with living specimens; he detests them and thinks they're stupid. Like \"the Russian,\" Hitler raves, the horse would \"throw away all upbringing\" in an instant if it were not kept in check. He doesn't think much of the cavalry either. The classic cavalry has gradually had its day. However, the horse remains indispensable as a load carrier, draft horse and mount for messengers and scouts. It started raining at the beginning of September 1941. So violent and persistent that the puddles no longer dry, continue to grow and the ground softens to the depth. Motorbikes and motor vehicles get stuck in rows in the mud, the advance stalls. Only the horses continue to pull the carts out of the dirt, even though they have long since sunk to their belly in the mud. The cold follows the mud. Rivers freeze, the engines fail and Siegfried's warm breath freezes in the air to ice crystals. Price inquiry time 26.06.2020 11.30 p.m. No guarantee The joint path of Max Kuhnert and Siegfried ends somewhere in the spring of 1942 in the wasteland of Russia. In an attack, Siegfried is seriously injured by a shrapnel. Kuhnert has to watch helplessly as he bled to death. \"For me he was not just a horse,\" he later wrote in his English memoir \"Will We See Tomorrow? A German Cavalryman at War (1939.1942)\". \"He was my best friend.\" The fate of horses concerns many soldiers. In numerous field post letters they describe their suffering and death: \"Torn from grenades, inflated, eyes popped out of empty red caves, standing and trembling, slowly but steadily bleeding from a small hole in the chest - that's how we see them now Months, \"writes one. \"It's almost worse than the torn faces of people.\" But the longer the war lasts, the more often the \"comrade horse\" is fatal to his own combatants. Nowhere is this more evident than in Stalingrad. The 6th German army, which is supposed to occupy the industrial city on the Volga, is hopelessly underserved. In November 1942, the Red Army managed to encircle them. A quarter of a million soldiers are now trapped - with them 52,000 horses and mules. With continued isolation, more and more animals are moving into their own pots. \"As long as we still have horses, it will work, and besides, the Fiihrer will not leave us,\" writes a German soldier full of hope shortly before Christmas 1942. But Hitler demands that the soldiers persevere and break the encirclement on their own, which fails . In order to keep the soldiers alive, 4,000 horses of the allied Romanian cavalry are slaughtered and processed into meat soup. \"The last horse has been eaten up for a long time and no idea when the shit will end,\" writes a soldier in mid-January 1943. When the half-frozen and starved 6th Army surrendered in the ruins of Stalingrad two weeks later, there were originally 250,000 German soldiers trapped 90,000 still alive. None of her 52,000 horses come out alive. They were all frozen to death, died on the battlefield, or eaten. How far the shadow of Stalingrad still extends and how emotionally we are still connected to the horse was last seen in spring 2013: in several European countries, supposed beef products appeared in supermarkets at that time, which actually consisted largely of horse meat. An outcry went through the country. However, there is no \"little girl hysteria\" behind it, but historical experience, wrote the daily newspaper \"Die Welt\": \"Nowhere is the disgust for horse meat as pronounced as in the generation that still experienced the Second World War and the post-war years.\" Cultural historian Peter Peter also saw \"an unpleasant memory, especially among older people\" - in \"emergency slaughter of horses, in Stalingrad pictures\".\n",

            " Microsoft operates 82 of its own stores worldwide - but that should now end. The software company announced that it would withdraw from retail. The shops are to be closed. Only the stores London, New York, Sydney and near the company headquarters in Redmond should remain as \"Microsoft Experience Center\", in which no more goods will be sold. Microsoft did not say how many jobs will be affected by the measures. The company announced that retail team members would continue to serve customers from Microsoft offices and offer remote sales, training, and support. Microsoft began in 2009 to mimic the success of the numerous Apple stores in the United States with a chain of retail stores. Microsoft products such as the Surface computers or the Xbox game console were sold there, as well as devices from manufacturers such as Dell, HP and Lenovo. In addition, new technologies such as Hololens augmented reality glasses were presented. However, the Microsoft Stores could never match the economic success of the Apple Stores, also because Microsoft no longer had its own smartphones after the Windows Phones were discontinued, while the iPhone drove business in the Apple stores. 72 stores were located in the USA, the rest in Canada, Australia and Great Britain. Microsoft did not have its own stores in Germany. Accordingly, the Group's showroom in Berlin is not affected by the austerity measures. Online activities are also continuing: Microsoft will continue to invest in its digital shops on Microsoft.com and in shops for Xbox and Windows, reaching more than 1.2 billion people in 190 markets every month, the company said.\n",

            " An investigation by the Fraunhofer Institute for Communication, Information Processing and Ergonomics (FKIE) has identified serious security deficiencies in Internet routers for private users. The gaps ranged from missing security updates and easy-to-guess passwords - for example \"password\" - that could not be changed by the user to well-known vulnerabilities that should have been fixed long ago. Not a single router among the 127 devices examined by seven manufacturers was without errors, the conclusion of the investigation. Some are even affected by hundreds of known vulnerabilities. The researchers often searched in vain for four of the five most common protection mechanisms against attacks. In the past twelve months, the investigation showed that 46 routers had not received a single security update, one for as long as 2000 days. AVM did the best, followed by Asus and Netgear. Most of the time (90 percent) versions of the free Linux operating system would be used on the routers, but these are often outdated. Linux is known for the fact that security gaps are quickly closed, the researchers emphasize. The manufacturers would only have to quickly install the current software - which, however, usually does not happen. At first glance, this coincides with the latest findings from Stiftung Warentest, which tested eight routers in May. Only three of them received security updates automatically and regularly. However, the foundation did not find any massive security gaps that could have been exploited from a distance. Three WLAN routers even offer \"very good security functions\". The FKIE researchers, on the other hand, draw a grim conclusion: \"Much more must be done to make routers as secure as today's desktop computers or server systems\".\n",

Via the so-called affiliate links in the text, the publisher, but never the author individually, receives a small commission from the dealer for sales. Since the outbreak of the corona crisis, meetings have mostly been held via video conference. At first it seemed like an emergency solution, but now many are aware of the advantages. The saved travel expenses alone should ensure that online meetings will remain the rule even after the crisis. If you want to make a good impression, you should ensure clean sound and a pleasant picture impression. This works quite well with current smartphones - but if the device tips over when talking to the boss, it can spoil the best presentation. A tripod, which gives the cell phone a firm hold, also makes it easier to adjust a picture section that does not give an unwanted view of privacy. And, not by the way, such tripods can of course also be ideally suited to stage yourself on trips or excursions. • Alfort smartphone tripod (15 euros) - the cheapest model in the test comes from Amazon - despite the low price there is even a Bluetooth remote release included • Hama Flexpro 3in1 (18 euros) - the relatively long legs can also be attached to bars • Joby GorillaPod Starter Kit (30 euros) - the provider Joby was the first to come up with the idea of ​​producing mini tripods from flexible individual links - the system can be flexibly expanded • Lamicall mobile phone holder (25 euros) - this gooseneck can be flexibly bent and can be bent at the edge of a table to be connected • Manfrotto PIXI Smart Kit (35 euros) - Manfrotto also produces professional tripods. This is noticeable in the particularly good workmanship and the high-quality materials. Handling: How difficult is it to fix the smartphone in the holder - and to take it out again. Smartphone hold: It was assessed how securely smartphones of different sizes (from iPhone 4 to Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra) were sitting in the holders. Flexibility: How high and how low can the smartphone be positioned, can it be easily rotated in portrait and landscape format, do parts of the tripod cover the camera? Stability: All tripods were placed on a work table with smartphones of different sizes and weights (between 144 and 201 grams) - is there a risk that the device will tip over or wobble? Rainer Claassen The cheapest tripod in the test field weighs just 56 grams - that's only a quarter of the weight of the largest smartphone we tried. As long as this is housed horizontally, it is also quite stable, if you want to film yourself in portrait format, the combination can easily tip over. With the legs covered by soft foam, the tripod can also be clamped on a monitor and then has more grip. The included Bluetooth remote release worked smoothly with both iPhones and Android devices. You should be careful with the ball head and its clamp fixation - both appear very delicate. Those who like to travel lightly and handle their tools carefully will be satisfied with the inexpensive tripod. Price inquiry time June 26th, 2020 11:31 pm No guarantee The tripod from Hama weighs almost 350 grams. At first glance, the 20 cm long legs look as if they were rigid, but they can be bent. The Flexpro can also be attached to other objects. The red collar on the tripod head can be turned in two positions, in which the legs are either at a narrow or a wide angle (with more stability). The ball head looks stable and also allows the smartphone to be positioned vertically. It can be pulled out up to 30 centimeters above the floor space without the risk of tipping over. If the camera is positioned at this height on the desk, the person sitting in front of it can put itself in the spotlight. Price inquiry time 06/26/2020 11:31 p.m. No guarantee The kit from Joby - without the supplied accessories - does not weigh 60 grams. It is very compact, so that a smartphone can be attached a maximum of twelve centimeters above the table top. With the flexibly twistable links of the three legs, the tripod can also be attached to a lamp base, for example. This is the only way that the phone can be aligned vertically, since there is no ball joint between the legs and the head. Practical are the three additional heads supplied, on which, for example, a GoPro Actioncam or a flashlight can be attached. There are various extensions in the Joby system that can be combined with this bracket. Material and workmanship have a high quality. Price inquiry time 06/26/2020 11:31 p.m. No guarantee The clamping device of this gooseneck tripod can be clamped to plates up to seven centimeters thick. A screw fixation ensures a secure hold without scratching surfaces. The clamping device for the smartphone is located at the end of the approx. 60 cm long gooseneck. It can be bent very flexibly - with a little effort - so that the smartphone camera can be positioned precisely. Although this holder is primarily intended to position smartphones in bed while reading, it also does an excellent job as a tripod. The biggest disadvantage: If you hit the tabletop during a recording, the smartphone can vibrate for a few seconds due to the long bracket. Price inquiry time June 26th, 2020 11:31 pm No guarantee Those who like it stylish and robust will like the Manfrotto mini tripod, which weighs over 200 grams. Of all the models tested, it has the longest life - especially the clamping device on the ball head is much more stable than that of the other models. If the button on this device is pressed, the ball can be turned into the desired position, if you let go, it is held in place without the risk of wobbling. It is a pity, however, that there is no recess on the bracket that would allow the smartphone to be positioned vertically. The three legs are folded out to the side and only stand securely on smooth surfaces. The smartphone comes to a height of 15 centimeters in the holder. If you need more and have photo equipment, you can use a standard extension, such as that available for photo tripods. Price inquiry time June 26th, 2020 11:31 pm No guarantee. I recently listened to a podcast with Matt Mullenweg. The leading developer of the WordPress blogger software keeps the globally operating company on track with practically all online meetings. In conversation, he made it very clear that good picture and sound quality are essential for efficient online meetings - the man needs to know. The tripods from this comparison meet different requirements. But each of them is definitely superior to most home-made solutions. Personally, I found the gooseneck of the Lamicall cellphone holder the most appealing for 28 euros - even if it tends to wobble a little. The most durable product is the 35 euro Pixi Smart Kit from Manfrotto.\n",

            " SPIEGEL: Professor Groebner, the vacation season has begun - but this year a lot is different. Anyone who has booked a trip abroad is worried about whether and how they can start it. Traveling for pleasure and relaxation is considered a good place to live today. How long has it been like this? Valentin Groebner, 58, teaches medieval history at the University of Lucerne. He made a name for himself with studies of modern history and historical narration. In 2018 his book Retroland was published. History tourism and the longing for the authentic, S. Fischer Verlag, Frankfurt am Main. Groebner: Since industrialization. The fact that normal industrial workers and employees can even go on vacation is a maximum of 70 years old, tourism as a phenomenon of the middle classes is 150 years old. Before that, hardly anyone could afford it; the transport and subsistence costs were far too high compared to the available wages. The fact that we travel naturally and frequently is therefore not based on an urge for freedom, but on the mass prosperity after the Second World War. SPIEGEL: But there were also ancient Romans who wanted to see the pyramids and later gentlemen who went on the \"Grand Tour\"? Groebner: Yes, but that was always very, very few from the top class. When Michel de Montaigne traveled to Italy in 1580, he knew the few compatriots he met there from the French court. SPIEGEL: So travel is a very young luxury phenomenon? Groebner: I don't like to use such a derogatory expression. In 2019, 1.5 billion people traveled - the highest number ever determined. They don't all do something completely superfluous. Conversely: we are now experiencing a temporary return to control and border regimes, as they existed in the twenties or fifties of the 20th century, and we are confused: suddenly, restriction and nation-state return, which before, in the supposedly good old days, made traveling a tedious, tedious thing for most people. SPIEGEL: In the good old days, there were travel guides that also explained the area visited historically. Only a few were looking for nature, right? Groebner: That's right. Before the 19th century, nobody wanted to go to the beach. SPIEGEL: Was it primarily about understanding the country and its people culturally? Groebner: Yes, especially the remains of the great past. The oldest travel guide for Rome, the \"Mirabilia Urbis Romae\", was written by an Englishman in the 12th century. Vacation in the good old days SPIEGEL: Wasn't the plant mainly a pilgrim guide? Groebner: There are also astonishingly pious things in it. For example, a naked marble statue of Venus is described, clearly a pagan work. The ancient world was considered a super civilization, a more perfect counter-age. The remains of this imagined chamber of wonder of the past were admired. The image was conveyed through wild, colorful stories. The so-called Gesta Romanorum, \"Acts of the Romans\", have been widespread since the 14th century, full of betrayal, murder and homicide in many morally exemplary, captivating stories. Educated people had already learned their Latin from the poems and historical works of the ancient Romans. SPIEGEL: Did you consciously seek out the scenes of major government actions, battles and exploits? St. Mark's Square in Venice Groebner: Some did. Others didn't care, they wanted to go to the prostitutes in Venice, of which there were printed catalogs for tourists from the 16th century. Most of the travel guides offered as broad a range of topics as possible, in part because it justified why the expensive trip had been taken. Being able to demonstrate world knowledge helped with my career. Some then simply wrote in their own travel reports what was in the guide to make an impression. SPIEGEL: So the tourist before 1800 drove to places he already knew from reading - to experience them culturally as his own? Groebner: Mostly yes. The only exceptions are trips to nature: in seaside resorts, to thermal springs, there were those very early; and then into the wild, romantically inflated Alps, around 1770. SPIEGEL: Did you want to immerse yourself in history as a traveler? Groebner: At least some wanted that. When Johann Gottfried Seume, an under-educated citizen with military experience, walked from Grimma to Syracuse on foot in 1802, he had his ancient classics with him. Still, he was disappointed at how little you saw. It was from this need that historical monuments emerged in the 19th century: Europe was deliberately rehistorized - and in turn promoted further historical tourism. Hermann Monument in the Teutoburg Forest SPIEGEL: Monuments to large battles such as the Hermann Monument in the Teutoburg Forest or the Niederwald Monument with its Germania obviously served to strengthen nationalism. Were there examples of such bourgeois excursion sites? Groebner: Battle chapels have been built in Italy, France and Switzerland since around 1500. They almost always come from the winners. But there they thought of the dead locally, they were hardly real travel destinations. The best way to forget lost battles, of course. Victories on the other hand - especially those over the Ottoman Empire - were monumentalized and designed. SPIEGEL: All of this sounds as if genuine, unfiltered curiosity about the past, like then, was the complete exception. Or do you even think it is impossible? Groebner: The kind of past that you want to have yourself is always reconstructed, exhibited and celebrated. The past, which is used for political and tourist purposes, is a first-person narrative, a kind of distant mirror in which one looks at oneself. On the other hand, curiosity and the desire to be on the move in certain phases of life seem to me to be a basic human characteristic. In pre-modern times, very few could really afford this \"vacation\". Vacation is a very old word, it means: discharge from duty. SPIEGEL: It is precisely this obligation - including the release from the prescribed house arrest - that many are concerned with today. You simply dream of basking on a beach lounger ... On the deck of a Groebner cruise ship: That is also strange. SPIEGEL published a cover story a year and a half ago: How the tourist destroys what he loves. Do we want to go back to \"overtourism\"? Is it the good old days? But hardly. The vacation has long been a consumption ritual, not a discharge from duty, but just another kind of duty. I find cruise ships particularly strange where enormous discipline is necessary - \"entertainment barracks\" would have been what the cultural philosopher Siegfried Kracauer called it. Perhaps we should take advantage of the current crisis and think more freely about being released from duty. SPIEGEL: What do you mean? For example: rediscover local museums in your free time? Groebner: Let us hope that this will happen - but don't forget: According to the latest reliable figures, the German museums had more visitors than all the Bundesliga games together. No, I mean something simpler: Tourism, which is supposed to serve the good life, is the opposite of employment; this is how it came into being. New forms could focus even more on informality and doing nothing, thus relieving them of the supposed educational obligation. SPIEGEL: Do you recommend meditation leave? Groebner: (laughs) The great thing about the industry is that it promises to keep customers from being saved from the industry itself. But the auto industry can do that too. They are simply mature service industries that offer complete artificial worlds - and now in a next turn also market the escape from these worlds that they have created. SPIEGEL: No escape offers are discernible on the pop culture history market; the range extends from the archeology app to the crusader game, from reenacting medieval battles to the television series. Are you a scientist worried about this virtual past tourism? Groebner: No. All of these phenomena arose like tourism itself in the 19th century. It was industrialization that turned the austere Middle Ages into the origin of one's own, the tempting, picturesque counter-world. Since then, citizens have disguised themselves as knights and performed historical dramas - preferably at the original location. Literary re-enactments, first on the opera stage, the mass medium of that time, are now being replaced by new technical toys. The mode of thinking, the search for romantic originality and intensity, has remained the same. Price inquiry time June 26, 2020 11:31 pm No guarantee SPIEGEL: Has your own wanderlust and your curiosity about history changed when you think about these phenomena? Groebner: Yes. I just finished a book called \"Ferienmüde\". There is, for example, a chapter on the tropical beach: What are we looking for? Or: In a picturesque old town with geraniums in front of the windows like Salzburg or Constance, what do we actually see? What does the tourist find at the destination of his longing? As often as one has thought critically about it - so far this has only led to even more tourism offers. But now there are clearly limits to growth. Maybe we are experiencing the end of \"Endless Vacation\". Let's wait and see.\n",

            " The podcast \"Das Coronavirus-Update\" by Berlin-based virologist Christian Drosten and NDR journalist Korinna Hennig won the jury and audience awards at the Grimme Online Award. The undoped Grimme Online Award is the most important German award for outstanding online journalism and has been awarded since 2001. The jury announced that terms such as herd immunity, number of reproductions and seasonality had also made it into general use through the podcast. The podcast demonstrates that even extensive science journalism can captivate the audience. The format also opened up new audience groups for the medium podcast. The podcast, which is currently in the summer break, also won a vote by Internet users on all the nominees. The video \"The Destruction of the CDU\" by YouTuber Rezo won an award in the \"Special\" category. Rezo had previously won the Nannen Prize. Rezo had criticized, among other things, the CDU's climate policy in the video. It also sparked a debate about the role of social media in forming and dealing with parties. Two awards went to the public service content network Funk. On the one hand, the jury praised the investigative video report format \"STRG_F\", which, among other things, caused a sensation with fake allegations against the moderators Joko and Klaas. The second radio format with the Grimme Online Award 2020 was the \"Karakaya Talk\" - a web talk show with Esra Karakaya, which provides a forum for people with a migration background. Other prizes went to the NSU-Watch weblog, which once documented the NSU process. Since then, the journalists and scientists have continued to research, including on the right-wing scene as a whole. The \"RomArchive\" was awarded to a project that deals extensively with the cultures of the Sinti and Roma.\n",

            " The cameras of many current smartphones deliver amazingly good photos even in poor lighting conditions. This is not least due to the fact that the data recorded by the photo sensors are processed internally by software. This is much more complicated when it comes to video recordings - which is why brightening the subject with lamps in many cases ensures visibly better results. The LED lights tested here are suitable for such purposes. They are all relatively inexpensive, light and provide noticeably more light at least up to three meters away. This can help with video conferences, for example, to make a better impression. But of course the tested lights are also suitable for taking better photos and especially videos in the evening or in closed rooms. The products recommended here were selected subjectively, but independently of the editorial team. Via the so-called affiliate links in the text, the publisher, but never the author individually, receives a small commission from the dealer for sales. Aputure AL-F7 portable LED video light (116.62 euros) - despite the relatively high price, no battery is included. However, the light can be operated via the USB-C connection, for example with a power bank as a power supply. Enegon Camera video light panel (60 euros) - the noblest lamp in the test has the format of a current smartphone. Useful accessories are just as important as a transport case. Godox LED64 Video Light (22 euros) - the square lamp is operated with four standard batteries or rechargeable batteries - so you have to plan for their purchase price. Joby Beamo LED light (89.95 euros) - despite the small size, the light output is good. This particularly robust model can even be used under water. Equipment - what is included in the scope of delivery, what setting options do the lights offer? Can the color temperatures be set? And: how bright are the different models. Fastening options - are there recesses for hot shoes or threaded holes with which the lamp can be screwed onto a tripod? Power supply - is a battery integrated, or can an external power supply be connected? Processing - mobile devices should also be durable - how robust are the lights made? Brightness - a white wall was illuminated from a distance of 1.5 meters. With a high-quality camera, we measured the shutter speed required for a correct exposure at an aperture of 5.6. In this model, 256 LEDs are housed in an area of ​​15.4 x 8.7 centimeters. Half of it shines in a very cold light, the other in a warm light. The light temperature can be set between 3200 and 9500 Kelvin (K) with a rotary control. Threads are attached to three sides of the robust light. A solid ball head, which can be screwed to it, is in the package as well as two diffusers that can be clamped in front of the illuminated surface. Only the power supply is missing. It can be done via USB-C cable or via one of the batteries with NP connection that are widely used in the photo sector. LED displays on the back show the charging status and the current settings of brightness and color temperature. The Aputure was clearly superior to the competition in terms of luminous efficacy: at maximum brightness, an exposure time of 1/80 second was sufficient. Price query time June 26th, 2020 11:34 pm No guarantee This flat model is the easiest to take with all test candidates - with 14.7 x 7.8 centimeters and a depth of just under 1.2 centimeters it has the format of a current smartphone. The metal cover looks high-quality, and the operation is well thought out: A long press on the power button switches on the LED elements, with two other buttons brightness and color temperature (between 3200 and 5500 K) can be regulated. If you want it even cooler or warmer, you can clamp one of the supplied spreading discs in front of the panel. A white diffuser is also in the package - and a small ball head with a threaded hole and slot for a hot shoe. The current settings are shown on the back of a small display. The light output was not quite as abundant as in the Aputure model - but it was quite respectable. Great: The display shows exactly how long the battery lasts at the currently selected brightness - at maximum output, the luminaire manages over an hour. Price inquiry time June 26th, 2020 11:34 pm No guarantee. 64 LEDs are housed on a square surface of about 7 x 7 centimeters - they provided the lowest light output in the test field. The cheap light does not allow a change in the light temperature, the rotary control on the back is only used to adjust the brightness. A hot shoe adapter is integrated in the lower side surface of the lamp - with a thread holder, with which the lamp can be screwed onto a tripod. The housing itself is very light at 130 grams, but four AA batteries are required to operate the lamp - together with these, the lamp weighs 240 grams. Alternatively, there is also a socket through which the device can be operated with an external 5-volt power source - unfortunately not in a common USB format, but as a jack socket. Three recesses on the sides of the housing make it possible to combine several lamps of this type with a plug connection. Price query time June 26th, 2020 11:34 pm No guarantee Those who spend a lot of time outdoors and do not always handle their gadgets carefully will have fun with the small lamp from Joby. The cube-shaped housing is shockproof and waterproof (up to 30 meters deep). A reflector bundles the luminous flux of the brightly shining LED unit so that less light is emitted to the sides than in the other test candidates. The integrated battery can either be charged via a USB-C connection or wirelessly. With two buttons, the brightness can be regulated in five levels - the color temperature corresponds to that of daylight. The concept is well thought out: with the magnetic back, the luminaire can be attached to metal surfaces. There is also an integrated holder for tripod threads and two clamping devices in the form of a hot shoe. In continuous operation, the lamp is a little more than lukewarm, but you will not burn yourself. Price inquiry time 06/26/2020 11:34 p.m. No guarantee In bright sunshine it doesn't take much to make an appealing video recording - regardless of whether a smartphone or a classic camera is used. However, indoor lighting is often not sufficient for good results. Whether you want to make a good impression with the application video or video conferences - or want to shine with better pictures of the family: The lights presented here can all ensure better video quality. If you don't have too high demands, you can get by with the cheapest Godox model. The most professional impression is made by the lamp from Aputure, which also shines the brightest. Outdoor fans will especially enjoy the waterproof model from Joby, which shone with a battery life of over two hours.\n",
