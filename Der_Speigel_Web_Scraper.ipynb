            " A thick cloud of Sahara sand has reached the Caribbean and is now moving towards the US coast, reports the US Weather Service. Measured by its size and concentration of dust, it is the largest cloud of its kind in half a century. The phenomenon is therefore known as the \"Godzilla\" cloud. Because of the dust particles, the air quality has already reached values ​​in some regions of the Caribbean from which experts assume a possible health hazard. People in affected regions are encouraged to stay indoors and use air filters if they have them. At nine million square kilometers, the Sahara is the largest dry desert on earth - and the largest source of dust on our planet. Every year, around 500 million tons of it fly from there to different parts of the world, sometimes thousands of kilometers away, including Germany. San Juan: The visibility at the airport was less than eight kilometers. It is normal for dust clouds to form over the Sahara at this time of year, which are carried westwards by winds. The extremely dry and dusty air moves across the North Atlantic approximately every three to five days from late spring to autumn, reports the U.S. Climate Change Agency. Dust transport across the Atlantic plays an important role for ecosystems. For example, sandstorms from the Sahara in the Amazon region fertilize the rainforest. In the Caribbean, almost the entire upper layer of the earth comes from Africa. During the summer months, the Sahara clouds move towards the Caribbean, in winter to the Amazon region. This time, however, the dust cloud is exceptionally large. Satellite images from NASA show how the cloud has spread since mid-June. In the meantime, it stretched more than 3,200 kilometers from the west coast of Africa to the edge of the Lesser Antilles in the western North Atlantic. The visibility at the airport of San Juan, the capital of Puerto Rico, was just eight kilometers. \"This is the most significant event in the past 50 years,\" said environmental scientist Pablo Méndez Lázaro from the University of Puerto Rico. Meanwhile, the cloud is moving toward the southeast coast of the United States.\n",

            " According to UNESCO, more than 250 million children worldwide have no access to education. This emerges from the UN World Education Report, which will be published this Tuesday. According to this, an estimated 258 million children, adolescents and young people did not attend school in 2018. This corresponds to around 17 percent of all school-age minors. The number has decreased since the turn of the millennium. At that time it was more than 350 million. According to the authors, the main problem is poverty. \"Poverty affects attendance, graduation and learning opportunities,\" says the UN report. Despite advances in reducing extreme poverty, particularly in Asia, one in ten adults and one in five children are affected - in sub-Saharan Africa even every second child. But factors such as gender, origin or disabilities also often led to exclusion. In at least 20 countries - most of them in sub-Saharan Africa - rural girls have almost no chance of finishing secondary school, the study said. The UN has actually set itself the goal of guaranteeing every young person the option of a medium-level education by 2030. Separate education for children with and without disabilities is also required by law in a quarter of all countries worldwide. Minorities and refugees are also not given sufficient access to quality education in many countries around the world. A lot has already been achieved in Germany, said Walter Hirche, board member of the German Unesco Commission. \"But the majority of children and young people with special educational needs still learn separately, instead of attending classes in general schools,\" says Hirche. \"We have to change that.\" German Development Secretary Maria Flachsbarth emphasizes the importance of the corona crisis for educational opportunities: \"In the context of a crisis, such as the current Covid 19 pandemic, existing inequalities are worsening worldwide.\" Overall, according to Unesco, more than 90 percent of all learners worldwide were affected by school closures in the corona crisis. According to Unesco, 40 percent of the poorest countries did not support poor or vulnerable students during the pandemic.\n",

            " The United States has reported another high level of new corona infections. According to data from Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, around 34,700 new infections were detected - the highest level since the end of April and the third highest daily value since the beginning of the corona crisis. In comparison, the daily value on June 1 was around 17,400 new infections. The highest number so far (36,400) was recorded on April 24. After other states, the most populous US state, California, also had the highest measured number of new infections. Governor Gavin Newsom said 7149 new cases were added on Tuesday. The occupancy of the hospitals has increased by almost 30 percent compared to two weeks ago. Newsom called on the nearly 40 million inhabitants to stay at home, keep their distance and wear masks if possible. The intensive care beds of hospitals in the Texas metropolis of Houston are now 97 percent full, said Mayor Sylvester Turner, according to the \"New York Times\". Around a quarter of these patients are infected with the coronavirus. \"I have a strong feeling that we're moving in the wrong direction - and we're moving fast,\" he said. The United States is now carrying out significantly more tests than a few months ago, as US President Donald Trump has repeatedly cited as an explanation for the high number of cases. However, the increasing number of hospital admissions is an indicator that the situation is getting worse again. Experts such as the leading US immunologist Anthony Fauci are particularly concerned about the development in Florida, Texas and Arizona. In view of the rising infection rates in many parts of the United States, the states of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut are imposing a two-week quarantine on those who enter from states with a higher infection rate. The rule will come into force on Thursday, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said. A list of the affected states is continuously updated. Initially, it would include Florida and Arizona. Meanwhile, the US broadcaster NBC News reported that the government in Washington plans to stop funding federal funds for 13 test sites by the end of June. Seven test sites in Texas are affected. This does not mean the end of government support, but Washington wants to help the testing in other ways, the broadcaster said, citing the US Department of Health. The plans didn't mean less testing, it said. Despite the development in Arizona, Trump had performed there in front of an audience on Tuesday. For the most part, his followers wore no masks in the closed room and sat close together. Trump is repeatedly accused by his opponents of downplaying the scope of the pandemic. Rather, a few months before the November US election, his focus is on getting the country's economy up and running again. With more than 2.3 million known corona infections, the United States has more documented cases than any other country in the world. More than 121,000 people died from Covid 19 disease.\n",

            " When the \"MSC Zoe\" container ship broke down in the stormy North Sea a year and a half ago, the deck cargo and its so-called lashing system were subjected to enormous forces and accelerations. This emerges from the final report, which experts from the Federal Bureau of Maritime Casualty Investigation have now presented. The lashing system that complied with the applicable rules finally no longer withstood the extraordinary loads. This has led to the collapse of container stacks. The high stability of the ship, which is typical for container giants, had a negative impact in the accident. The ship's straightening ability was \"characterized by short phases of taxiing and a sudden return to its original position\". The ship, which is almost 400 meters long and 59 meters wide, lost 342 of a total of 8000 containers on the night of January 2, 2019 on its way from China via Portugal to Bremerhaven. The ship flying the flag of Panama was not damaged. 297 containers sank in Dutch waters near the island of Ameland, 45 off the German island of Borkum. Most of the containers burst on impact with the water, and as a result tons of garbage drove to the beaches.\n",

            " On Thursday morning, a man armed with a knife in the community of Twist in Lower Saxony is said to have threatened and attacked several people in a doctor's office and a neighboring house. This was announced by the public prosecutor's office in Osnabrück in a press release, leaving the man's origin unmentioned. Apparently no one was injured at first. When the police, alerted at 10.25 a.m., arrived at the scene, the asylum seeker from Guinea had already left the house. \"The man should then have turned to the officials and attacked them with the knife,\" it said in the press release from yesterday. Thereupon there was an \"use of the service weapon with firing by a police officer\". The man was \"seriously injured\" by a shot in the thigh. He had to be resuscitated on the way to the hospital. The asylum seeker, who is said to have been in Germany for a long time, succumbed to his serious injuries last night. The public prosecutor has launched preliminary investigations. Then it will be decided whether to initiate an investigation against the police officer. So far, there is no evidence of misconduct by the official, it is said. It is not known why the 23-year-old went to the doctor's office with a knife.\n",

            " To help people in the corona crisis directly, U.S. President Donald Trump's government sent checks of at least $ 1200. These were mistakenly sent to more than a million dead, as the US Court of Auditors wrote in a report. According to the report, nearly 1.1 million payments totaling just under $ 1.4 billion were made to the deceased by the end of April. The Ministry of Finance and the tax authorities had not compared their data with the declarations of the deceased by the social security authority before sending the aid checks, the report said. The background was therefore legal uncertainties. Data reconciliation was only introduced before a fourth payout round and after a legal clarification. The tax authority published a notice on its website in early May that payments made by mistake to the dead had to be reimbursed. According to the Court of Auditors, the authority initially did not plan a direct request for repayment to the actual recipients, e.g. relatives. Accordingly, it is still unclear how many checks have been returned or to what extent the banks have rejected transfers of the $ 1200 to the account of the dead. The relief checks were decided at the end of March as part of the largest rescue package in US history. In the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, the money should protect people from possible financial bottlenecks and support consumption. US citizens with an annual salary of up to $ 75,000 received checks of $ 1,200, while working couples with a salary of up to $ 150,000 received $ 2,400. In addition, there was $ 500 per child. The money could be paid out as a check, bank transfer or directly to a bank card. According to the Court of Auditors' report, 160 million payments totaling $ 269 billion were made by the end of May. The entire rescue package, which also provided aid for troubled corporations and small and medium-sized companies, was worth around two trillion dollars. Back then, criticism had caused the US President Donald Trump's name to be printed on the checks. There has never been anything like this when the tax authorities paid out. The addition of \"President Donald J. Trump\" was also reportedly delayed the issuing of the checks for a few days.\n",

            " The Dax group Wirecard is sinking ever deeper into a balance sheet scandal. The Munich I public prosecutor has now arrested the resigning head of the financial services provider, Markus Braun. The manager confronted the investigators on Monday evening, as the prosecutors said. The Austrian would be brought before an investigating judge at the Munich district court during the day, who would decide whether to detain him. The law enforcement officers accuse Braun of a message that they have inflated Wirecard's total assets and sales volume \"through feigned income from business\" in order to make the company more financially sound and more attractive for investors and customers. The investigators focus on alleged bank balances on trust accounts with two Philippine banks in the amount of more than 1.9 billion euros. Because auditors could not find any evidence of the existence of the money, Wirecard's annual financial statements had not been audited. Air bookings have apparently brightened the balance sheet of the high-tech company from the Munich suburb of Aschheim. After it became known that around a quarter of the total assets were missing, the company's share price plummeted, the rating agency Moody's initially set Wirecard at a junk level and finally completely removed the rating from it. Braun portrayed Wirecard as a victim of fraud, but resigned at the end of last week. His former right-hand man, Jan Marsalek, was fired by the supervisory board, he had run day-to-day business. In the night to Sunday, Wirecard had to admit that the bank balances \"did not exist with a high degree of probability\". At the center of the scandal are the former Wirecard CFO in Southeast Asia and a former trustee, who was responsible for the business with third-party companies, which was presumably largely non-existent.

            " However, the investigators are now assuming that there were confidants or accomplices in the German company headquarters. According to the public prosecutor's office, Braun's behavior, according to the current legal review, justifies suspicion of falsification of the balance sheet in several cases with market manipulation. Both are punishable. Pre-trial detention can be imposed, for example, if the judiciary poses a risk of escape or blackout. The Munich public prosecutor's office has been investigating Braun for weeks, but originally only because of the suspicion of having misinformed investors in two ad hoc notices.

            " Summer holidays begin in the first federal states. Travel abroad has long been off the table for many Germans because of the restrictions in the Corona crisis 2020. But now problems can also arise domestically. After the Covid19 outbreaks in slaughterhouses in North Rhine-Westphalia, more and more federal states are issuing bans and bids for travelers from high-risk areas. On the Baltic Sea in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, holidaymakers from the Gütersloh region have already been turned away or asked to leave prematurely. The provisions range from mandatory quarantine and ban on accommodation to the requirement to prove a current and negative corona test. Read here what is currently valid in the state of your travel destination. The overview shows the situation as of June 25th and will be updated if necessary: ​​For visitors from a city or district with an increased infection rate, there is a ban on accommodation in hotels, inns, pensions, holiday apartments, campsites and on motorhome parking spaces. From such a risk area comes whose home district has exceeded the nationwide threshold of more than 50 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants in the past seven days before arrival. Exceptions apply to people who can prove that they are not infected with a medical certificate. Exceptions should also be possible if the outbreak in a district can be clearly localized. Accommodation establishments in Bavaria may not accept guests who arrive from a district or an independent city in another federal state or who have their residence there if the number of new corona infections within seven days was more than 50 per 100,000 inhabitants. This does not apply to people who have a negative corona test and who have a medical certificate. Berlin is currently not planning any residence or accommodation bans, expulsions or quarantine regulations for visitors or vacationers from risk areas in Germany. The following applies to high-risk countries abroad (mainly outside Europe): 14 days of domestic quarantine after return. Anyone entering Brandenburg must return to a two-week quarantine when returning from a risk area specified by the federal government. The state government is still discussing a possible change with a view to the virus outbreak in the two counties in NRW. There are currently no restrictions for people from Gütersloh and Warendorf or from other municipalities in Germany. The current Hamburg Corona Ordinance has so far only provided quarantine regulations for immigrants from abroad. Anyone who has been in a risk area classified by the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) at any time within 14 days before entering the Hanseatic city is obliged to go straight to a two-week quarantine at home. Federal rules on domestic travelers are considered unrealistic in the Senate, circles say. The aim is therefore to find solutions that are as common as possible with the other northern German states. Thus, Hamburg is also threatened with a ban on accommodation for people arriving from a circle in which the upper limit of 50 infected to 100,000 inhabitants is exceeded. The Hamburg regulation to contain the corona pandemic is to be renewed on Tuesday, new regulations would then apply from Wednesday. There are currently no restrictions for people from Gütersloh and Warendorf or from other municipalities in Germany. People from corona risk areas are only allowed to enter if they can prove that they have taken a corona test within 48 hours before entry. It must be clear that there is no evidence of coronavirus infection. Anyone entering a risk area without this certificate must leave the country. Anyone who has been in a risk area abroad for at least two days in the past two weeks must start a 14-day quarantine after entering Lower Saxony. For tourists from the North Rhine-Westphalian districts of Gütersloh and Warendorf, the following applies: From Friday onwards, you may only spend the night in hotels, holiday apartments or campsites with a negative Corona test. Returning travelers from risk regions abroad must be quarantined for 14 days. So far, there is no regulation for travelers from Germany in NRW. Anyone who comes to Rhineland-Palatinate from Corona risk areas must go to a two-week quarantine immediately after entering the country. According to the state chancellery, the rule applies to risk regions in which the rate of new infections with the coronavirus is higher than 50 per 100,000 inhabitants within seven days - and applies from June 26. So far there are no restrictions for people from Gütersloh and Warendorf or from other municipalities in Germany. Prime Minister Tobias Hans has already spoken out in favor of a ban on travel for people from rural areas with high corona infections. The CDU politician is still fighting for a \"nationwide uniform procedure\". Saxony's Minister of Social Affairs Petra Köpping (SPD) had initially spoken out against a general ban on accommodation for tourists from high-risk areas - and is using negative tests as an entry requirement. For travelers from high-risk regions, there should only be a ban if the travelers have not been able to submit a negative test from the last 48 hours. A final decision has not yet been made. In the discussion about a ban on accommodation, Prime Minister Reiner Haseloff (CDU) said the question was \"not whether, but how\" appropriate regulations would be enforced. The ban could be part of the next Corona regulation, which is due to enter into force on July 2nd. Corona hotspot travelers have had to go to their home or other suitable accommodation immediately after entering Thursday to isolate themselves for 14 days - or they must have a negative corona test that is no older than 48 hours may. According to the state government, exceptions are possible if, for example, outbreaks in individual circles can be clearly limited regionally - and will then be published by the state government if necessary. Entry and accommodation bans are currently not planned. Health Minister Heike Werner assumes that the corresponding outbreaks can generally be clearly localized. The left-wing politician does not want to \"take an entire district and all the people living there in clan detention\".\n",

            " The Tönnies company, the largest German slaughterhouse, has become a corona hotspot. Two out of three employees tested, more than 700, are infected. The slaughterhouse is dense, as are daycare centers and schools in the Gütersloh district. The German slaughterhouses as pillars of the cheap meat industry are once again on fire. Greed for profit and contempt for human beings have made them gruesome places to exploit workers and animals. A nested system of sub-sub-subcontractors with dubious work contracts becomes visible, the slave-keeping of Eastern European and other migrant workers becomes visible. The shadow army of the auxiliaries, which also sticks our asparagus, harvests our grapes and catches fish for us on industrial ships, is again in focus: lousy payment despite bone jobs, unworthy accommodation in container-like crates, poor hygienic conditions and inadequate medical care. So the workers are exposed to the virus almost without protection. is a journalist and author and was formerly an editor at \"taz\". He specializes in environmental and nutrition issues. Politicians have looked away for years. Only now that the slaughterhouses have become super spreaders of the corona epidemic, is it finally taking action. Not because the Eastern European auxiliary workers are so dear to her, but because the slaughterhouses endanger entire areas. Rheda-Wiedenbrück, Coesfeld, Birkenfeld, Dissen, Bad Bramstedt, Oer-Erkenschwick, Straubing-Bogen are the virus-infected hot spots. Remote places that nobody visits. Slaughterhouses are social no-go, unsettling places outside of our perception. Now she's pulling the virus out to light. The outrage is great. And there can be no excuses. Neither do the slaughterhouse operators have their own voluntary commitments, as they did in 2017, which are then not complied with: now, in addition to the prohibition of contracts for work, crystal-clear rules and laws are required. The slaughterhouse operators have to hire, pay, accommodate and transport their own employees - and they have to be responsible for them. Accommodation and pay must be decent and appropriate for the dangerous and psychologically stressful work. Actually a matter of course. But real reform must go further. It cannot be that the locations of our meat production remain taboo zones of society, basically prohibited terrain - well camouflaged, built in structurally weak spaces, partially protected by barbed wire and dog patrols. Slaughterhouses have developed into un-places whose image is most comparable to brothels or prisons.

Society and the media are no longer allowed to look away and face their guardian role and the reality in our slaughterhouses. After all, no bricks are made here, food is produced here, that cannot and must not happen in secret, under the social radar. The transparent, the glass slaughterhouse must be the goal. So far, the meat industry has refused to look over its shoulder; it wants to spare us the faster and faster pace of killing. The meat - decoupled from blood, sweat and bone fragments - has mutated into appetizingly neatly packed protein porn, eye and palate feast far away from the bolt shot.

It was suspect if the butcher worked in the locked room because there was no way to convince yourself of the quality and health of the slaughter cattle. Perhaps slaughter was better, more democratic and more transparent in the dark Middle Ages than in 2020.\n",

Accordingly, one person jumped out of the window of the blazing apartment. Despite immediate medical care, the man died. According to the police, the fire has since been put out. The cause of the fire is not yet known and is currently being determined. According to the police, a body was discovered during the evacuation work in another apartment. However, there is no connection to the fire. In addition, there is no evidence of a violent crime, the police said.\n",

When he had to brake due to a slower vehicle, he lost control of his car. The car was thrown about 300 meters over the highway and hit the central and outer guardrail several times. The man and his 49-year-old passenger were seriously injured in their car. The fire department had to cut open the car roof to rescue the couple. \"Such a roof has an insane weight, we have to handle that with three or four men on each side,\" said the city fire chief. \"And the injured man keeps the camera on himself, then on us again. You just shake your head.\" A rescue helicopter took the injured to hospitals.\n",

            " Almost ten years ago, the then SPD parliamentary group leader Frank-Walter Steinmeier donated a kidney to his wife Elke Büdenbender. In times of the prevailing corona pandemic, the lawyer is therefore prudent. Büdenbender told the newspapers of the Funke media group that she always had disinfectants and a mask. \"I avoid crowds of people and largely also public transport.\" Whenever possible, take the bike or walk. \"The restriction of our freedoms was massive,\" said the 58-year-old. You can understand that some of them were \"totally surprised\". At first she felt the same way, but she never questioned the measures. The distance to loved ones, however, was a problem for her, Büdenbender reported. She hadn't seen her 89-year-old father or 90-year-old mother-in-law for more than two months. It is an extraordinary situation when you can no longer meet people in person. \"A disturbing experience,\" said the former judge. It is important to her to bring people together and to be close to others. \"And now I can't hug anyone anymore.\" The wife of the Federal President is also concerned about the unequal distribution of burdens: Büdenbender is convinced that trying to balance work and family despite Corona restrictions would have put women back more than men. \"Obviously the women in the families bore the brunt,\" she told the newspapers of the Funke media group. \"What strikes me is that women in the Corona period fell more into traditional role models than men agreed to take back their jobs.\" It was mainly women who \"kept the shop going\" in clinics, nursing homes, schools, day care centers and shops. And for that they should finally be paid appropriately. However, the lawyer does not share the thesis of the sociologist Jutta Allmendinger that the emancipation was thrown back by Corona by 30 years. \"I see great progress, for example in women’s employment,\" she said. Women in the west would have benefited from women in the east. When it comes to filling senior posts with women, there is still a problem.\n",

            " \"The Last of Us Part 2\" forces players to endure raw fantasies of violence and pure lust for revenge and to go along helplessly. That was what my colleague Carsten Görig wrote in his test for the recently released, apparently fascinating Playstation 4 exclusive title \"The Last of Us Part 2\". He portrayed Naughty Dog's post-apocalypse game as a \"trip into the abyss of the soul\" as a \"journey into hopelessness that is hard work\". Scene from \"The Last of Us Part 2\": Here it has been activated that the speaker name is always shown and colored in the subtitles. I want to be honest: I have a game like that right now, in the middle of summer, during the Corona pandemic and with the scenes of violence from the USA in front of you, no desire at all. I am not tempted by the fact that \"The Last of Us Part 2\" is interestingly the first big video game that not only hints at queer stories, but also tells them, as our author Matthias Kreienbrink describes here. So why am I dedicating this newsletter to \"The Last of Us Part 2\" anyway? Quite simply: Because this game is a milestone in game development, regardless of personal taste. And I don't mean the excellent graphics, the animations or the dialogues. I am concerned with its accessibility. \"The Last of Us Part 2\" is essentially a classic video game with shooting and sneaking passages - a title that, like every other Playstation hit, is controlled via gamepad. But probably no blockbuster before has allowed players to adapt their gaming experience in such detail to their wishes and needs. In addition to five levels of difficulty, the game also offers special setting packages for \"barrier-free vision\", for \"barrier-free hearing\" and also for \"barrier-free motor skills\" that can be selected right at the start. The motor skills package, for example, is aimed at players with physical and physical disabilities and includes things such as automatic aiming at enemies, an automatic weapon change and protection against the character falling off protrusions by entering the player and thus dying. In addition, puzzles can be easily skipped if desired. The game offers three setting packages, but it can also be set much more individually. Several dozen such options can also be selected and deselected individually: You can activate as much help as you like at any time. Numerous at once, none at all or even a few very specific ones. Especially for players with disabilities, this selection is a blessing that even brings tears to some - but all other players also benefit. There are a few controls on the subject of \"combat\", from \"hostages do not escape\" to \"invisible in the prone position\" For Playstation titles, I have often been annoyed at how small the font in menus and subtitles is. With \"The Last of Us Part 2\" there are no such problems, as I checked in a short test. Here you can even set that all text overlays such as \"press any key\" are read out loud and that subtitles show what the speaking person is called and where they are in virtual space. With the subtitles it can be set that an arrow signals where there is a speaking figure in the game world that is not currently visible in the image section. Ultimately, I still do not want to play \"The Last of Us Part 2\". But I am genuinely pleased that the developers of this game have really done a lot to ensure that everyone who does it differently has the chance to experience it. Other studios should definitely be inspired by the accessibility of \"The Last of Us Part 2\". Many books and newspaper articles on digital topics age poorly. In retrospect, which pixel worlds were considered problematic in the past is only amusing, just like the tech junk that the Pearl catalog once wanted to sell. With such thoughts in mind, I recently ordered a two-decade-old network guide called \"Looses Internet-Handbuch 2000\" - a book with clouds on the cover from which giraffe heads stick out. From today's perspective, that should be full of anecdotal gold and hackneyed wording, I thought to myself. A little browsing taught me otherwise. Sure, many of the websites recommended at the time no longer exist and many once important brands such as AOL have had their best days. But otherwise, many chapters of the book, which comes from before Facebook and Co., still seem reasonably appropriate. To the question \"Can I get rich through the Internet?\" For example, it says, \"Yes, no, possibly - maybe the question should be better: 'Can I continue to make money without the internet?'\". You could still answer that today. Two weeks ago I already recommended a computer game package to you here, the proceeds of which will benefit groups that work against racism and for equality. An impressive eight million dollars were ultimately collected with the Itch.io bundle, and almost 1,400 developers made their works available. The Itch.io package is no longer available for purchase, but the \"Humble Fight for Racial Justice Bundle\" is a new, equally interesting set. This package for 28 euros - or more on a voluntary basis - contains significantly fewer games, but mostly well-known titles that can be played on the Steam gaming platform. These include the original puzzle game \"Baba is you\", the party game collection \"Jackbox Party Pack 4\", the racing game \"Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing\" and the basketball game \"NBA 2K20\", as well as indie classics like \"Spelunky\". With the \"Football Manager 2020\" it also contains a real time eater for football fans. Some comics and e-books are also part of the bundle. It can be paid for here via PayPal, credit card or Alipay, and the money raised from the Humble offer is also donated in the context of the US protests. \"The sugar mountain of the spread thighs\" (podcast, 88 minutes) Hardly anyone has shaped the online porn business worldwide like Fabian Thylmann. In Philipp Westermeyer's \"OMR Podcast\", the German entrepreneur, who today owns the Cologne club \"Bootshaus\" among other things, tells how he once was able to build a porn empire with platforms like YouPorn and Pornhub - and how the business model of such sites continued after he left works. \"The Corona app starts to work as soon as 15 percent participate\" (five minutes of reading) In media reports on the Corona warning app, it was often said that according to an Oxford study, at least 60 percent of the population would have to use such an app this way the pandemic could be stopped. The researcher Lucie Abeler-Dörner tells the \"Süddeutsche Zeitung\": \"The app actually works best when many people use it. However, our simulations show that the app starts to work as soon as 15 percent of the population takes part.\" \"Facial Recognition\" (video, 21 minutes) In the course of the recent protests against racism and police violence, facial recognition was again a topic of debate.

            " Apple has been running the iDevices and Macs on two tracks for years. Therefore, the question regularly arises when MacBooks and iMacs will get touchscreens, as they have long been common in Windows 10. But Apple always refused, just as there shouldn't be a trackpad for the iPad. And as is the case with Apple, it was the best and greatest trackpad when it suddenly came. The same could be the case with the MacBook with the touchscreen. The fact that Apple now wants to switch from Intel to its own processors paves the way for a final reunification of all Apple platforms. It is undisputed that the company can build fast processors. The iPhone with the A13 and the iPad Pro with the A12Z have long been on par with Intel Macs. In complex applications in which many things can be processed simultaneously and in parallel, they achieve better results across the board. The impressive image processing of the cameras, the speech recognition, in short the whole area of ​​artificial intelligence (AI), runs faster than on Intel processors thanks to the so-called Neural Engine, an area specialized in AI in Apple's processors. The graphics output is also impressive. In this regard, a current iPad Pro is a thousand times faster than the first iPad. Schematic representation of an Apple processor: The chip consists of many units optimized for certain tasks. It is impressive how little technology the iPhone and iPad can perform. If you take the display out of the device, you can see almost only batteries in the housing, the main boards are so small that the processors share with radio modules and memory chips. If Apple is now preparing to build laptops and desktops using this technology, completely new designs are conceivable. About an iMac just a few millimeters thick in the style of a giant iPad. With SSD instead of hard disk and fanless and therefore noiseless cooling. An iPad Pro only sweats when you charge its battery. Such designs are possible because Apple's own processors use little power. \"Performance per watt\" is the catchy formula. It is important to generate a lot of computer power with little electricity. This not only benefits the battery life, but also the heat management. Anything that uses little electricity does not become warm. What does not get warm does not need an annoying fan. So far, this has been the main bottleneck that slows notebooks, including Apple's MacBooks. The processors in slim Ultrabooks burn 15 watts, faster laptops even 45 watts, with Macbook Air it is only 10 watts. Own processors not only enable thin hardware, but also a uniform software landscape. The same software can then run on a desktop computer as on an iPhone or an Apple Watch. That doesn't happen overnight, Apple is already preparing us for a two-year transition phase. But the march started last year. More and more Mac software is based on iOS apps. This is sorely needed because hardly anyone likes to write Mac software anymore. For Apple, this is not the first change in processor technology. 15 years ago the company switched from PowerPC to Intel chips and now from Intel to \"Apple Silicon\". There is already a developer kit, a Mac mini, with an iPad processor for $ 500, which the developer can only rent but not buy. It was to be expected that this would not be a laptop, because otherwise everyone would have capitulated on battery tests. Incidentally, the new chips do not yet have a name. It will only be announced when Apple announces the first computer with the new hardware. At the moment the end of the year is being targeted. It can be assumed that the group will roll up its offer from behind in this transition. First the less powerful MacBooks, then the iMacs and finally the high-end Macs with a \"Pro\" in the name. Despite such plans at Apple, the Intel Macs are far from over. The company emphasizes that there are still some new machines with Intel chips in the pipeline and that Intel hardware will continue to be supported for years to come.\n",

            " After a long discussion, Federal Minister of Agriculture Julia Klöckner agreed to an animal welfare fee in order to help finance better husbandry conditions. \"Meat is too cheap,\" said the CDU politician at the dpa news agency. She campaigns for an animal welfare tax, which is recommended by an expert commission. \"Something will also have to change for consumers. Meat should not become a luxury product for the rich. But it should also not be everyday junk.\" A commission headed by former CDU Agriculture Minister Jochen Borchert made recommendations in February to improve animal welfare in livestock farming. To finance this, the Commission proposes an animal welfare tax on animal products, but this should be accompanied by social policy in view of households with lower incomes. Klöckner now said that fair prices and subsidies made it possible for farmers to convert their stables. \"But if the meat industry and retail trade push the price more and more, then the animal owners will not be able to do it.\" It is therefore important to help the farmers that they can cover the costs of converting the stables. Agriculture minister Klöckner: fair prices for fair stables The \"Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung\" had previously reported that the Bundestag factions of the Union and SPD had agreed on price premiums for meat, milk and eggs. The parliamentary groups wanted to present to the federal government \"a short, medium and long-term implementation strategy for the transformation of livestock farming within this legislative period\", it said, referring to a draft proposal by the two parliamentary groups. The political groups also refer to the expert opinion on Borchert. Klöckner was reluctant to levy on meat for a long time. When the topic was discussed in summer 2019, she welcomed a statement that there was a sensitivity to the fact that more animal welfare costs more money. But she also said: \"The money does not have to come automatically from tax increases, but can be achieved by setting priorities.\" In the meantime, the experts around Borchert have suggested that animals be given more space in the barn and \"as possible contact with the outside climate\" made possible. The conversion and maintenance costs are to be financed through an excise tax. The panel of experts proposed surcharges of 40 cents per kilo of meat, two cents per kilo of milk and per egg and 15 cents per kilo of cheese or butter. The current decision may have been fueled by the massive corona outbreaks in Germany's slaughterhouses. They had highlighted the working and manufacturing conditions in the industry. After the federal cabinet had presented its plans for how to deal with it, Aldi, one of the most important trading partners, called for even greater price cuts for sausage products, as the prices for pork are in the basement.

Animals, farmers and also the workers in the slaughterhouse would suffer as a result. Albert Stegemann, Union spokesman for agricultural policy, said the recommendations of the Borchert Commission were \"a great opportunity for greater animal welfare and consumer confidence in agriculture\". Animal welfare and animal husbandry have been widely discussed in Germany in the course of a more conscious diet for years: Most recently, a survey commissioned by the Federal Ministry of Agriculture had shown that the daily diet of many German citizens had changed in the corona crisis. Accordingly, people appreciate regional products more. According to the \"Nutrition Report\", meat consumption by Germans is also continuing to decline slightly.\n",

            " The World Bank's staff representative calls for Abraham Weintraub's nomination to be reviewed as executive director. This emerges from a letter quoted by the Reuters news agency. The background is racism allegations and other reservations against Weintraub, who was previously Minister of Education under Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. Weintraub had sparked several controversies in the past. In May, for example, he compared searches of the Brazilian federal police to the Reichspogromnacht in Nazi Germany on November 9, 1938, causing outrage at the Israeli embassy, ​​among other things. In April, Weintraub said at a cabinet meeting that the Supreme Court judges belonged behind bars. An investigation by the Court of Auditors is also underway against him because he is said to have traveled to the USA with a diplomatic passport after his term of office ended. The World Bank staff urged the organization's ethics committee to suspend Weintraub's nomination until it was examined whether previous statements complied with internal rules of conduct. They quoted Weintraub's statements on Twitter, making fun of Chinese accents, blaming China for Covid-19, and accusing the country of seeking world domination. There were also statements by Weintraub against minority protection and his last decision as minister to lift some minority quotas at universities. The World Bank will not tolerate racist statements by employees, Reuters quotes from a response from the chairman of the ethics committee, Günther Schönleitner. However, neither the committee nor the management of the World Bank would have any influence on the nomination. Brazil has a majority vote in a group of nine countries that need to fill the vacant post. Weintraub is the only candidate for the executive director position. There are currently 25 executive directors at the World Bank. Brazil leads a group of nine countries at the World Bank and controls the majority of the bloc's votes. If other voters object to a candidate, the lead country will propose a different name according to World Bank practice. Note: We have added details on the advertised item.\n",

            " Filipino Wirecard trustee Mark Tolentino, who is said to have managed 1.9 billion euros on behalf of the payment service provider, has nothing to do with the unfair business of the German scandal group from Aschheim, according to its own statements. In a statement available to SPIEGEL, his lawyer Dennis Manalo \"relentlessly\" assures that Tolentino's law firm MKT Law has no knowledge of \"alleged irregularities\", according to which evidence of bank balances at two Philippine banks could be forged. The 1.9 billion euros are currently considered to have disappeared. Wirecard itself now assumes that the alleged bank balance does not exist \"with a high degree of probability\". The company suffered serious damage to its image due to the scandal and is struggling to survive. Tolentino's law firm adheres strictly to the laws of the Asian country, lawyer Manalo said. Without confirming the client's name, it is clear from the letter that Wirecard is meant. Manalo could not be reached by phone, the authenticity of the letter could not be fully verified by SPIEGEL. Tolentino is one of the central figures in the Wirecard scandal. As a trustee, he is said to have managed money for Wirecard that the group needs for its Asian business. Wirecard processes payment transactions between end customers and retailers and guarantees the latter that the money for the purchase of products flows. For this, the group has to hold money. Since in Asia, unlike in Europe, he does not hold any licenses to do business, he needs partners in the Far East and is allegedly not allowed to manage the money himself. Tolentino has been a trustee for Wirecard since 2019 after his predecessor had given up his mandate due to the many inconsistencies surrounding the company. Tolentino is said to have deposited the 1.9 billion euros on behalf of Wirecard with the Philippine big banks BDO Unibank and Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI). However, the institutes say they have no knowledge of the money. \"Wirecard is not a customer of ours,\" they said. Documents submitted by Wirecard external auditors were forged; Papers that were supposed to confirm a Wirecard account bear false signatures from bank representatives. The central bank of the Philippines is also at a loss. Where the money is, whether it ever existed or is part of a gigantic balance sheet fraud is unclear. Wirecard believes that he has been cheated and has filed a complaint against unknown persons. The lost amount of money corresponds to around a quarter of the balance sheet total of the payment service provider. Because it is missing, the auditor EY (formerly Ernst & Young) refuses the seal of approval for the Wirecard balance sheet for 2019. CEO Markus Braun has resigned, his intimate partner Jan Marsalek also had to leave. Wirecard announced on Monday that the Marsalek contract had been terminated extraordinarily.\n",

            " When haulier Joseph Diedrich acquired Feistritz am Wechsel in 1815, he had long been called \"Baron\", although he was not strictly speaking one. An ancestor had carried the title in recognition of his merits. Even Joseph, rich but middle-class, was now looking forward to such a title. What he had done in the wars against Napoleon contributed significantly to the success of the campaigns - Diedrich was something like Austria's chief logistics provider for the supply of the army. Soon after the end of the war, the newly minted castle owner was made a baron, synonymous with baron. Diedrich knew how to behave in a manner typical of the time. He renovated the castle in the style of early romanticism, the gardens became small copies of Versailles. In order to perfect the staging as a cultivated new noble, he had a castle theater built. And he equipped the armory with all sorts of historical artifacts and curios that simulated a long past. The most spectacular piece among them: an iron maiden. The term is self-explanatory today: you immediately see the image of a kind of sarcophagus in the form of a woman; inside there is a cavity lined with long metal spikes or knife blades. We know them from the genre literature (Bram Stoker: \"The Squaw\") and from countless B and C horror films. In the Middle Ages, according to Mär, something like this was a feared tool of torture and execution. There are three descriptions of how the virgin killed: the first says that the thorns or knives inflicted deep but deliberately non-fatal wounds on the victims so that they slowly bled to death. According to the second, the victim was literally dismantled by blades when the Virgin was closed. Long thorns pierced deep into the eyes, while cutting cut the body at least partially. In the third, the statue of the Virgin is a trap in front of which you fall through the floor and into a more or less refined snippet. There is also a description for all types that the remains of the victim were disposed of in a river through an opening under the virgin. This story symbolically embodies the entire cruelty of the \"dark\" Middle Ages, as is well known. No one has assumed that people in the Middle Ages were sensitive to prisoners, defeated or delinquents between 500 and 1500. The supposedly civilized Romans had already been cruel. But what people came up with in the Middle Ages in Europe to torture fellow human beings or to carry them from life to death is truly unparalleled. Sometimes it was punishment, sometimes revenge or the supposed implementation of \"God's will\". In retrospect, however, it often seems strangely meaningless: brutality acts as an end in itself, a perverse form of entertainment. Order now online and the booklet will be sent to your home! Order from Amazon. You can find SPIEGEL STORY by subscription at MyKiosk. The line between torture and execution was often blurred. Anyone who \"put a delinquent on the wheel\" and slowly crushed his bones accepted his death at least. A similarly bloodthirsty invention was the \"Scavenger's Daughter\" - a kind of size-adjustable metal ring, in which one could clamp a delinquent in a crouching position and slowly crush it. The executioner often dealt with the human body no differently than a butcher. The Iron Maiden fits seamlessly into this cruel picture. It's no wonder that their history made the rounds around the world. However, only from 1792 onwards. The lawyer and poet Johann Christian Siebenkees reported in his \"Materials on the History of Nuremberg\" from a chronicle, to which there is no information: \"In 1533, the iron maiden was erected for the Maleficians at the vaulted tower wall ... if one stood in line to justify, and that means 'send the poor sinners for fish', because there is an iron picture 7 shoes high in it, which spreads both arms against the maleficant. As soon as the executioner touches it, it strikes with a broad one Hand-saber him into small pieces, which pieces swallow the fish in hidden water. \" Siebenkees translated the execution sarcophagus described above into modern language. That sounded convincingly medieval. However, Siebenkees himself also expressed doubts about the rumored story: \"I don't know whether there is any trace of the one described here, nor have I read that it was used. Maybe the whole thing should be a legend?\" There had been stories of similar killing mechanisms in ancient times. The Grimm brothers' fairy tale collection, compiled from 1806, also contained three stories in which villains died from barrels spiked with nails. imago images / Arkivi The Iron Maiden - just a horror fairy tale? Only: Nowhere was an Iron Maiden found until the 19th century. And from the Middle Ages themselves, there was not even a mention of the terrible killing tool. Strange for a time when all possible methods of torture and execution were described in detail - from court records to contemporary \"event reporting\". The fact that ecclesiastical inquisitors use iron virgins is by no means documented in contemporary sources, but rather as a statement for the first time in a book from 1838: the Presbyterian historian of religion James Aitken Wylie called them in his \"History of Protestantism\" as evidence of Catholic cruelty. One can doubt the informant's neutrality. Nevertheless, the history of the Iron Maiden made the round. It fit perfectly into the spirit of the times: The heyday of Gothic literature also began in the early 19th century - bestsellers such as \"Frankenstein\" (1818) produced the genre of horror history. In 1839 the \"Leaves for Literary Entertainment\" blatantly ridiculed the desperate search of an American. Robert Lucas Pearsall had previously searched for a real iron maiden in Nuremberg, Prague, Innsbruck, Salzburg and Berlin: \"For a long time he crawled around in all basements and underground civic prisons - to no avail.\" In Nuremberg, it is said, Pearsall has made many efforts to help \"a man who is said to be particularly experienced in the city's antiquities\". He only found what he was looking for in Styria, in the castle of Baron Dietrich. With \"no less than 23 knives and daggers\", his iron maiden \"once terribly killed unfortunates\". Pearsall wrote it down under the title \"The Kiss of the Virgin\" and also delivered a first drawing. He should not remain the last visitor to Baron Dietrich. In 1846, Joseph Adalbert Krickel described a visit to Feistritz Castle in his book \"Excursions to the regions of the country below the Enns and Styria\": \"In the other tower you can see the iron maiden, a machine that was made for those who had never seen it before has seen horror. \" Krickel had probably paid admission for the visit. This should explain exactly why the sightings of Iron Maidens increased in the course of the 19th century. After all, something had also been discovered in Nuremberg after Pearsall's visit: The city-famous antique dealer Georg Friedrich Geuder - possibly the antiquity expert tried by Pearsall in Nuremberg - was lucky enough to find a real Iron Maiden! Historian Sylvia Kesper-Biermann, a true connoisseur of the subject, assumes that Geuder also worked as a craftsman. She considers the virgins to be medieval \"shame coats\", which were subsequently provided with thorns or knives. Nuremberg thus gained a real attraction; In 1857, Geuder opened the first torture museum in the German-speaking cultural area in what is known as the Frog Tower. The location was perfectly chosen: in 1801, Christian Conrad Nopitsch had confirmed the Frog Tower in his \"Guide for Strangers in Nuremberg\" as the original original location of the Iron Maiden previously described by Siebenkees - one has to assume that \"everyone knew\" that now. The visitors were horribly scared, the museum was a complete success and attracted numerous competitors in other cities. When the tower was demolished a good 20 years later, the city built a torture museum in the tower of the city castle as a replacement. It existed until 1945 - and it is said that the Nuremberg Jungfrau was still to be seen here in the 20th century. Even the only professional inspection of the apparatus could hardly diminish its fame: the knives inside, it was found, were French bayonets from the Napoleonic Wars. The Iron Maiden, it seems, was born somewhere between a pile of early horror literature and the emerging \"dark tourism\": \"Fake News\" of the early 19th century - a story that was so good that it simply had to become reality. The bottom line, as rumor spreaders Siebenkees had indicated, was probably only a legend.\n",

            " A 29-year-old was sentenced to prison after attacks on police officers as part of the New Year's Eve riot at Connewitzer Kreuz in Leipzig. The district court in Leipzig found the man with multiple previous convictions guilty of assaulting and resisting enforcement officers, insulting and threatening him, as the court confirmed to SPIEGEL. It sentenced him to one year and two months in prison. Judge Birgit Riedel justified the decision, saying that a suspended sentence is out of the question because of a poor social forecast. The verdict is not yet legally binding. The defense announced that it would consider appeals. The defendant is said to have been pushed aside by a police officer on New Year's Eve in Leipzig and therefore made a kicking movement. But he didn't meet anyone. During the subsequent arrest, he is said to have defended himself and insulted and threatened three officers in one case. The next morning, the 29-year-old is said to have pushed a police officer to the side in central police custody and also insulted him. The 59-year-old policeman was not injured. During the riots in the left-wing alternative district, stones and firecrackers were thrown at the police, among other things, an official was seriously injured in the ear. The accused, who has been in custody since January 2, has no connection with these acts. Conversely, activists accused the police of being too brutal. Two women have filed complaints. The police also had to correct the statement that an official had undergone an emergency operation - there were also doubts about other information. The situation in Connewitz escalated again a few weeks after New Year's Eve. Around 1600 people demonstrated against the ban on the platform \"Linksunten.Indymedia\", according to police, six officers were injured by throwing stones; journalists also reported attacks.\n",

            " After the arrest of Brigitte Mohnhaupt and Adelheid Schulz in 1982, the police ransacked the homes of 14 people on the same day, whom she had found in the depots, including Wolfgang Grams and Daniela Klette. Both were temporarily arrested and released after a few hours. Klette, now 61, Burkhard Garweg, 51, and Ernst-Volker Staub, 65, are said to have committed robberies with pistols, Kalashnikov rapid-fire rifles and bazookas from 1999 to 2016. Klette appeared in BKA lists of alleged supporters as early as 1979, 1981 and 1982 together with Grams and Birgit Hogefeld. A few years later, Grams and Hogefeld became leaders of the third generation. Klette's role in the RAF is unclear. Several DNA finds indicate that she was active in logistics and therefore familiar with the depot system. The Kalashnikov war weapon, however, is not typical of the RAF. It was routinely used to shoot exercises in the Middle East and the GDR. However, rifles from the class enemy, Heckler & Koch, were mostly used in attacks. The RAF logo also shows no Kalashnikov, but a Heckler & Koch submachine gun MP5, a standard weapon of the hated police. Only when the US embassy in Bonn was attacked in 1991 did the RAF fire a Kalashnikov. Is this weapon identical to the one used by RAF pensioners in 2015 and 2016? The projectiles found were compared to the central assault ammunition collection at the BKA, according to the Verden public prosecutor's office. She does not want to say anything about the result \"for tactical reasons\". Special reports, analyzes and backgrounds on topics that affect our society - from reporters from all over the world.

            " In an internet café in Ingolstadt, shots were fired around 9:15 p.m. Witnesses alerted the police. When the officers arrived, they found a man with life-threatening injuries. He died at the scene. A police spokesman told SPIEGEL that the alleged perpetrator was arrested by the emergency services without resistance. At the time of the act, there were other guests in the café who had been questioned. Traces had been secured at the scene until the early hours of the morning. The victim is said to be a 50-year-old man. The suspect is therefore 37 years old and comes from the Eichstätt district. He is under investigation for murder. The victim's body should be autopsied on Saturday. The alleged perpetrator should be brought before a judge, said the police spokesman. The background to the fact is unclear.\n",

            " The business of the DIY chain Obi flourished - and brought the Tengelmann group strong growth in 2019. Overall, the family-owned company, which includes Obi, the textile discount store Kik and numerous other holdings, increased its sales by 4.1 percent to 8.1 billion euros, as the business figures for the past year show. The company traditionally does not provide exact information about the profit. One of the most important growth drivers in the business empire of the billionaire family Haub was the hardware store chain Obi, which increased its sales by 6.5 percent to 6.8 billion euros, although the number of stores remained unchanged at 668 across Europe. Obi has again achieved a clearly positive result, the group reported. In contrast, the sales of the textile discount store Kik grew only slightly to 2.1 billion euros. The number of stores rose by 185 to 3881. \"In the home market, the sales development was a reflection of the developments in the overall market, which was characterized by the increase in online trade and lower frequencies in the city centers,\" the company reported. But Kik had achieved a clearly positive result in the difficult year for the entire textile industry. In the current year, the corona crisis should also leave clearly visible traces in the balance sheet at Tengelmann. Most stores had to close during the months of March and April and into May. After all, the hardware stores were allowed to continue to open in most federal states. The sales trend after the reopening was encouraging. However, it remains to be seen how sustainable this development will be and how the economic downturn will affect consumer behavior, the company emphasized.\n",

            " Just over a week after the introduction of the German Corona warning app, the program alerted users who were near infected people for the first time. Before that, around two dozen app users were registered as infected on Tuesday, estimates one of the developers involved. In the night from Tuesday to Wednesday, the anonymous identification numbers of these users were then transmitted via the app. For those who have had contact with them for a certain period of time, a corresponding warning is displayed in the app today. This can be understood, since some data of the app interface can be viewed by developers. Malte Janduda from the development team of the Corona Warning app explained the background to this on Twitter. However, the developers can neither see where infected people are or who they have been in contact with, nor who is shown a notification. It is also impossible to say how many people receive a warning about contacts with infected people. A user on Twitter showed what a warning in the app looks like with a screenshot: Here you will find an external content from Twitter that complements the article. You can show it with a click and hide it again.\n",

            " Whether there is a risk from contact with infected people and how high this risk is is not calculated centrally, but locally on the users' devices. When calculating, the app also includes how long the contact with infected people was, how much distance there was between the people and exactly when the infected people tested positive. The app can only show a rough risk of infection, so anyone who gets a warning message is advised to get tested. There is no obligation to do so. However, anyone who has received a notice in the Corona Warning app can be tested - even without Covid 19 symptoms. Technically, the process behind these notifications works as follows: If an app user has tested positive and enters this status in the app, an anonymous identification number of his device, a so-called day key, is sent to the server of the app. These day keys are automatically retrieved at regular intervals from all devices on which the app is installed. The devices then compare the day key locally with a second randomly generated number, the so-called short keys. These are exchanged between the devices via Bluetooth if they have been within a few meters of each other for a period of around 15 minutes or more. A list of these short keys is only saved locally on the users' devices. The daily keys can be used to calculate locally on the devices whether they match short keys of devices in the vicinity of which you have been. Since the servers of the app operators never know the short codes of the users, they cannot understand who was in the vicinity. This ensures that users' privacy is preserved and operators cannot create movement profiles or contact lists. You can voluntarily decide whether users store their infected status in the app. However, they have to prove that they are actually infected by scanning a QR code from a test laboratory or entering a tan from an official hotline in the app. Note: In a previous version of this article, it was said that around 300 people in the app reported an infection. In fact, the number is estimated to be between 20 and 30 users. However, around 300 so-called day keys have been stored in the app. These also include so-called fake keys, which were created to further increase data protection.\n",

            " The day before the Olympic Final, on September 1, 1960, Wilma Rudolph stepped into a hole on the practice course and twisted her ankle. The 20-year-old is considered a big gold favorite in the sprint for women over 100 meters. But can you become the fastest woman in the world with an injured ankle? On the other hand: If a participant of this Olympic Games in Rome knows about handicaps, it is this woman. It started with the fact that she was born on June 23, 80 years ago, as the 20th of 22 children in Clarksville, Tennessee. The father worked as a porter at the station, the mother as a servant. Money was tight, racism everywhere. These circumstances were life-threatening for little Wilma: at the age of four, she developed double pneumonia and scarlet fever, and shortly afterwards also polio. As a result of spinal polio, she was unable to move her left leg. There was no vaccine yet, and because hospitals were segregated, she and her mother had to drive to Nashville's Meharry Medical College, 70 kilometers away, once a week - on the back row of a greyhound bus. When she was eight years old she got a greave and later an orthopedic shoe. When she was eleven she played basketball in the garden for the first time. Barefoot. It was the beginning of a unique sports career. Just a few years after the doctors told her that she might never be able to walk again, a high school sports teacher gave her the acclaimed nickname \"Skeeter\", synonymous with mosquito in American English: \"Because you are small and fast and always like me Stand away. \" For her school team, she threw 49 points in just one game - the first of many records in her life. Ed Temple, a professor of sociology at Tennessee State University, who also oversaw the athletics division of his university, played a key role in this. Temple took the fast teenage boy under his wing and paved her way to the 1956 Melbourne Olympics. 16 years old and weighing only 45 kilos, Rudolph retired prematurely in the 200-meter semi-final, but brought home a bronze medal from the 100-meter relay race. Temple brought the sprinting talent to the university on a sports scholarship and in the following four years, he raised his protégé to 65 kilos. Now Wilma Rudolph was ready to show the hoes to the world. On the morning of September 2, 1960, America's fastest woman's ankle was still green and blue and clearly swollen. A few hours remained over 100 meters until the first semi-final. \"Skeeter\" Rudolph did a couple of test sprints - and decided to start. Betty Cuthbert, Australian Olympic champion from 1956, had already dropped out in the quarter-finals. So everyone looked at Wilma Rudolph. How good was the 20 year old really? Wilma runs you answered in 11.3 seconds. Even with a thick ankle, Wilma Rudolph had set a new world record. It was even faster in the final: hand-stopped 11.0 seconds! But due to the strong tailwind, this new record was not listed. Rudolph had won anyway - not just the gold medal. Her impressive running style made her a new icon of athletics in just two races. The world press immediately found a new epithet for the wonder woman: As the \"black gazelle\" she entered the Olympic annals. At a time when even the serious German press quite naturally admired the long legs of the \"Negress\", one was not even aware of the racist undertone of this nickname. Three days later Rudolph also won the 200 meters - ahead of West German Jutta Heine, whose silver medal was also a big surprise. Shortly afterwards, Heine landed again in second place with the German 4x100-meter relay. The USA became the winner with final runner Wilma Rudolph. Three gold medals at the Olympics, no athlete had done that before. Twelve years later, in the run-up to the Munich Games, \"Stern\" reporters visited the mother of five in Sacramento. They met a mature woman who had not run races for eight years and had enough time to analyze her own story. \"I have been celebrated as a symbol of free America,\" said Wilma Rudolph, \"today I know that I have been abused.\" Rudolph was asked by the reporters what she would do differently. \"I would fight for justice and against discrimination against blacks. I would throw the medals at Avery Brundage's feet. I despise him, he is a racist.\" The American Brundage was President of the International Olympic Committee from 1952 to 1972. The abuse began when Rudolph returned to the United States. It had just been celebrated by enthusiastic Italians, Greeks, English, Dutch and Germans during a multi-day European tour after the games. The governor of Tennessee, Buford Ellington, had proclaimed October 4, 1960 \"Welcome Wilma Day\". A big festival was planned in her hometown of Clarksville. Ellington was a clear advocate of segregation. Only after Wilma Rudolph threatened to stay away from the event was the separation of black and white removed for this day. The \"Welcome Wilma Day\" became the first integrated public event in the history of the state. The main character himself was blinded by this supposed success. When the \"Hamburger Abendblatt\" asked Rudolph about her most beautiful career moment a year after the victory of Rome on the edge of a Karlsruhe athletics meeting, she called the congratulatory telegram from the Mayor of Clarksville: \"You must know that he is a white man. He has had before in his life never congratulated a negro on anything. \" Rudolph found out that her country only used the success of his greatest black sports star to show himself as an open, just and anti-racist society that the United States is not today, just a few weeks after the celebrations when she and her father visited a trendy restaurant was denied. When there was more and more unrest and protests against racist America in the early 1960s, Wilma Rudolph also took to the streets. In May 1963, the once fastest woman in the world joined a protest procession in her hometown. At the same time, the young woman had to reinvent herself, even as a world-famous athlete, no money could be earned. After saying goodbye to the running track, she initially worked as a teacher, later she ran a community center in Indiana, worked as a press officer for a film studio and a baking chain, published books and gave lectures. The contact with her German colleague Jutta Heine never broke down over the years. Heine, who has been running the \"Blaue Mühle\" hotel restaurant in Burglahr for many years, remembers: \"As a young woman, Wilma knew exactly what she wanted - and how she could get it. She was aware of her special role and wanted to do it have also confirmed this. For example, if she insisted on traveling to be in first class. \" Her strong character, says Heine, helped her above all off the racetrack. However, Rudolph was not politically involved. In 1972 Richard Nixon wanted to win her as a still famous black face for his campaign - but she was more sympathetic to the black power movement. The \"world\" she quoted in 1976 as saying: \"There is no justice for us. The only weapon of the blacks is violence.\" Jutta Heine is convinced that Wilma Rudolph would also have played a leading role in the \"Black Lives Matter\" movement: \"She would have been among the front runners.\" From 1981, Rudolph put her energy into establishing the \"Wilma Rudolph Foundation\", which supports black athletes. \"If anything remains of me at all,\" she had once told the New York Times, \"it's this foundation.\" Wilma Rudolph died on November 12, 1994 of a brain tumor at the age of 54.\n",

Without the money, they would face bankruptcy. Are financial injections not legitimate in this exceptional situation? O’Leary: No, I don’t see any need for that. It's always the same for them: if they are in bad shape, the government should let them out. British Airways, Iberia, Ryanair or Easyjet also receive no government support. This distorts competition in Europe. If Lufthansa needs money, it should get it from its shareholders or cut costs. But I have to respect Carsten Spohr.

            " Russia is violating freedom of expression by blocking opposition websites, according to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). The regulations of the Russian information law, which is the basis for the closures, would have exaggerated effects, it said in a decision of the court published on Tuesday (here as PDF). In addition, there is no adequate protective mechanism to prevent abuse of the law, the ECtHR complained. Blocking the websites also affects the right to access information. Several operators of sites with government-critical content, including ex-chess world champion and Kremlin critic Garri Kasparow, submitted a total of four complaints to the ECHR. According to court documents, they said that the closures, which are said to date from 2012 to 2015, were unlawful and disproportionate. In addition, Russian courts had not adequately examined the barring of access. Russia now has to pay the operators 10,000 euros each. In Russia, hundreds of websites have been blocked by order of the Roskomnadzor supervisory authority. Portals of the Kremlin opponent Mikhail Khodorkovsky are also affected. According to the law, there is no censorship. However, the authorities can often block content without further explanation. International organizations such as Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and Reporters Without Borders have long complained of massive and arbitrary state interference in the right to freedom of expression. The ECHR, based in Strasbourg, France, is part of the Council of Europe. Together they take care of the observance and protection of human rights. The Council of Europe - not to be confused with the European Council and the Council of the European Union - and the General Court are not institutions of the European Union.\n",

            " The state is to join Lufthansa as part of a multi-billion dollar rescue package - the shareholders of the ailing airline have agreed to this. The decision at the extraordinary general meeting found a majority of around 98 percent of the capital present, said supervisory board chairman Karl-Ludwig Kley. The rescue plan for Lufthansa stipulates that the state should join the stricken airline. Specifically, the State Economic Stabilization Fund (WSF) is to subscribe to shares in the course of a capital increase in order to build up a 20 percent stake in the airline's share capital. In addition, silent deposits totaling up to EUR 5.7 billion and a loan of up to EUR 3 billion are planned. However, the latter is not subject to the requirements and was basically approved in March. With their approval of the state entry, the shareholders have created the conditions for the nine billion euro aid package. If the federal government's share in the share capital had burst, the rest of the rescue package consisting of a silent partnership and a KfW loan would have lapsed. In the struggle for the rescue package, the Lufthansa management had increased the pressure on the shareholders once again. \"We have no more money,\" said supervisory board chief Kley at the general meeting. Without the support package of nine billion euros, the airline Kley would have had to file for bankruptcy \"in the next few days\". After accepting the rescue plan, Kley said: \"We can do it!\" After the vote, the Lufthansa share expanded its price gains in late trading and rose by 9.1 percent to EUR 10.47. In the morning, the EU Commission approved the rescue plan. As a condition, the competition authorities enforce that Lufthansa must hand over 24 take-off and landing rights to competitors in Munich and Frankfurt. Commission Vice-President Margrethe Vestager said: \"This gives competing airlines the opportunity to enter these markets, ensuring fair prices and more choice for European consumers.\" Competitor Ryanair nevertheless announced a lawsuit against the aid. Aid is needed for Lufthansa because the corona pandemic has brought the company's business, with the exception of freight, to a standstill with the following travel restrictions. As a result, tens of thousands of jobs are on the brink in the group with around 138,000 employees. The worldwide headcount has recently been put at 22,000. Around 11,000 of these are in Germany. Most recently, state entry was on the brink: Lufthansa’s largest shareholder, billionaire and industrialist Heinz Hermann Thiele, had criticized the package and called for renegotiations. He considered the planned state influence too great, the price for the participation too high and the exit scenario almost impossible to fulfill. Thiele holds around 15 percent of Lufthansa shares and had a blocking minority in the decision due to the low participation of 39.3 percent of the voting rights. Finally, he announced his approval. Green economic politician Katharina Dröge sharply criticized Thiele's approach. \"I found it absolutely incomprehensible and irresponsible what Mr. Thiele was doing. For me it looked like a blackmail attempt to put the group's bankruptcy in the room, so that we could put pressure on and renegotiate,\" said Dröge on Deutschlandfunk. But it was a good signal that he was initially unsuccessful. Shortly before the decision of the Lufthansa shareholders, Federal Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) once again advertised the federal government's offer. \"There is a good offer on the table and Lufthansa shareholders should accept it,\" said Scholz. The federal government is offering support to Lufthansa and its more than 100,000 employees \"in an unprecedented emergency\", the aid package is at the same time \"the legitimate interests of taxpayers.\"\n",

But it works with so much love. And togetherness. And presence.\" According to the post, Barrymore also wonders what is really behind all the pictures that fathers show. She herself does not have a photo of her father that shows how great everything was, she wrote. \"I have a picture that shows what it was.\" That is her story - and that is why it is perfect. \"My father gave me the gift of life! A keen sense of humor! And this wildness that I really appreciate,\" she wrote at the end of her contribution.

            " For a long time, the Corona map of Germany was gray, calmly. But now the first red spots appear. The map shows which districts are scratching the decisive mark of 50 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants within seven days. From this value, the federal and state governments have agreed, new restrictions must be considered, as they now apply in the Gütersloh and Warendorf districts. The renewed lockdown could also be imminent in other regions - at least if you would like to call it that, after all, the measures in Germany were moderate compared to other countries and even now there are no curfews in Gütersloh and Warendorf. The district of Göttingen recently reported 46 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). As a few days pass before the reported cases of the individual health offices also appear in the RKI statistics, the number is likely to increase further. The district of Göttingen had already admitted on Monday that the \"50 alarm value\" had been exceeded. There are currently 268 people in the district who are known to be infected. As in Gütersloh, the Bundeswehr is now also supporting the health authorities in Göttingen in containing the outbreaks. There should still be no lockdown in the district of Göttingen. \"The current Corona outbreak is limited to the residential complex on the edge of the city center and under control. All necessary measures have been taken,\" said Mayor Rolf-Georg Köhler on Monday evening. However, there should initially be no lockdown in Gütersloh - with the same reasoning. The outbreak was limited to the Tönnies meat factory, Prime Minister Armin Laschet argued just a few days ago. Nothing has changed fundamentally in this assessment, the CDU politician said when he turned around on Tuesday and yet announced far-reaching restrictions. The renewed lockdown is a mere precautionary measure, mass tests in the coming days should show whether the virus may have spread unnoticed. Laschet must have made a difficult decision. Just a few weeks ago, he was one of the prime ministers who wanted to reopen as quickly as possible. Even though Angela Merkel did not name any names, the message should have been sent to Laschet when she warned at the end of April that the easing was \"partly very research, if not to say: to research\". However, it is only logical that Laschet is the first prime minister to impose a new lockdown, even though summer holidays are starting at the weekend in NRW and several federal states have already made it clear that they do not want holidaymakers from Gütersloh or Warendorf. \"In view of a problem of this magnitude, it is once again clear what tasks lie ahead of politics and the health authorities\", virologist Christian Drosten tweeted after the decision. \"The pre-test quarantine is a very good decision!\" At this point you will find external content from Twitter that complements the article.

            " In the coming days, significantly more orange and red spots could appear on the corona map: In Berlin, one of the three corona traffic lights has switched to red again because the R factor is currently 1.96 for the third day in a row higher than is 1.2. The capital recently reported 802 active corona cases - the highest number since May 1. Several districts are affected, including Marzahn-Hellersdorf, Tempelhof-Schöneberg and Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg. Nevertheless, the contact restrictions should drop from Saturday. In Magdeburg, about half of all known corona cases have been reported within the past two weeks alone. Several schools were closed, 19 blocks of flats are in quarantine and around 800 people are affected. Mass tests are planned in the Oldenburg district after Corona tests with 23 employees in a Wiesenhof turkey slaughterhouse were positive. Now all 1100 employees are to be tested. It would not be the first outbreak in a slaughterhouse. (You can read here why the virus seems to have such an easy game there.) The local outbreaks have increased the reproductive factor. According to the RKI, the value currently fluctuates by two - that is, statistically speaking, every infected person infects two more people. Actually, the value should be permanently kept below one, so that the pandemic goes down. However, because only a few cases were reported for the rest of Germany - at Tönnies alone there were more than twice as many new infections as were documented per day for all of Germany - the R-value lost its significance. (Read more here.) What does this mean for the pandemic across Germany? According to the RKI, a second wave should in principle be assumed everywhere, including in Germany. \"But I am optimistic that we can prevent the second wave,\" said RKI boss Lothar Wieler at a press conference on Tuesday. You would now know how to contain the virus without a vaccine. 137 counties in Germany have not reported a single case in the past seven days. Previous corona hotspots such as Heinsberg experienced just how quickly the corona virus can spread. There, a carnival celebration had fueled the pandemic. The authorities are now more vigilant. Potential superspreader events such as large events are still prohibited until at least the end of October. The current outbreaks in several regions can therefore only be compared to a very limited extent with what was happening at the time. However, they prove that the virus has not disappeared. And there are high-rise buildings and meat factories all over Germany. The contagion in the residential complex in Berlin-Neukölln was probably only noticed because two students had tested positive, who did not go to the same schools, but lived exactly in the residential complex that was later quarantined. Comprehensive tests are therefore all the more important in order to identify and contain local outbreaks as quickly as possible. \"If you make it too easy for this virus,\" said Health Minister Jens Spahn on Wednesday in the ARD \"Morgenmagazin\", \"then it will spread again very quickly.\"\n",

            " Poisoned drinks recently appeared in Munich supermarkets, and customers suffered health problems. Shortly afterwards, the police caught a 56-year-old suspect who is said to have been randomly handling poison. Investigators of the \"Tox\" special commission now assume that the woman has been circulating poisoned soft drinks since at least 2018. Two possible victims of the woman - two children - were identified in the course of the investigation, said the head of Criminal Investigation Department 11 of the Munich police, Josef Wimmer. The accused still does not comment on the allegations. Therefore, no motive is recognizable. The Special Commission is now looking for witnesses to similar incidents. It is currently about an event in Munich's Gasteig cultural center in November 2018. The two children, then seven and ten years old, had drunk apple juice and then felt dizzy, vomited, passed out and had to stay in the hospital for one night. According to current knowledge, there are no consequential damages. Among other things, witnesses saw a conspicuous woman at the event and recognized the suspect now, said Wimmer. In addition, the mentally ill woman wrote a kind of postcard that contained references to the incident in the Gasteig. Since there were no further findings at the time, the case was previously considered unsettled. In March and April four manipulated bottles appeared in two Munich supermarkets. Three customers had bought the poisoned bottles and drunk them. According to the police, two women between the ages of 34 and 42 needed immediate medical attention. A 48-year-old is also said to have had a bad life after eating. According to the investigators, the dose of the solvents could have been fatal. The police arrested the suspect in early June. At the behest of an expert, she was sent to a psychiatric hospital. The spokesman for the Munich police headquarters, Marcus da Gloria Martins, said the woman was not only traveling in the Munich area, but also nationwide. Wimmer added, however, so far there are no indications that she has committed attacks beyond Munich. Likewise, there is currently no indication that she was also out in the nightlife, for example in bars. Anne Leiding from the Munich public prosecutor's office said that the incident in the Gasteig was \"the worst thing that can be imagined for parents\". The authority is investigating multiple attempted murders, among other things, with poisoning that is dangerous to the public. Leiding also made it clear that it was very difficult to prove that an attempted murder had been made and that the investigators still had a lot of work to do.\n",

            " The highly contagious measles virus has probably been with humans for much longer than previously thought. This has resulted in an analysis of dozens of measles genomes conducted by the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). As the researchers report in the journal \"Science\", the virus probably originated in the sixth century BC and thus about 1400 years earlier than previously thought. Measles could have originated at a time marked by population growth and the emergence of large cities in Europe and Asia. With the new dating, the evolutionary history of the virus can be traced more precisely and better understood, under which circumstances other pathogens can occur. To spread, the measles virus relies on large, interconnected human populations. According to the study, the population density was probably not before the sixth century BC. The researchers therefore consider the scenario to be \"plausible\". The virus originally - like many other pathogens - passed from animals to humans, presumably there was a common ancestor of measles and the closely related cattle plague virus. When and under what circumstances this changed hosts is controversial. Although measles is sometimes considered a childhood disease, fatal complications can occur: According to the World Health Organization (WHO), around 2.6 million people worldwide died from the virus each year until a vaccine was introduced in 1963. In 2018, the disease still claimed around 140,000 lives. The international research team led by Ariane Düx first analyzed a specimen from the collection of the Berlin Medical History Museum of the Charité. It is the lung in formalin of a two-year-old girl who died of measles in 1912. The scientists reconstructed an almost complete measles genome from the sample, which they claim is the oldest sequenced genome of a human RNA virus. \"We were thrilled that our experiments worked right away and that we were able to extract viral RNA from such an old sample,\" said co-author Sébastien Calvignac-Spencer, according to an RKI announcement. In the next step, the researchers compared this pathogen genome with the previously published genomes of related viruses. They used the so-called molecular clock, in which the time when two variants were derived from a common ancestor is estimated on the basis of the genome: the more mutations that have arisen after the split, the longer the development time. For this purpose, the scientists analyzed the genomes of the sample from 1912 with the genome of a measles sample from 1960, with 127 modern genomes and with those of rinderpest and pseudorinderpest. On this basis, they estimate that measles may have been around since the sixth century BC. \"Previous studies, which are also based on molecular clocks, assumed that measles only appeared in the Middle Ages,\" said co-author Philippe Lemey from the Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium. \"However, no long-term evolutionary dynamics were included in these calculations, so the age of the measles virus was significantly underestimated.\" One cannot say with absolute certainty whether measles originated directly in the sixth century BC and whether its development was linked to demographic changes, says historian Kyle Harper from the University of Oklahoma, who was also involved. \"But such a scenario is definitely plausible and can no longer be excluded.\" For the molecular biologists Simon Ho and Sebastián Duchêne from the Universities of Sydney and Melbourne, it is to the merit of the investigation that the measles genome has been successfully obtained from a sample that is more than a hundred years old: \"The acquisition of genomic data from RNA viruses (such as the Measles virus), which decompose rapidly in the environment, is extremely difficult, \"they write in a\" Science \"comment. They emphasize that the new corona virus has shown how important it is to understand the history of pathogens: the evolutionary history of Sars-CoV-2 is still unclear. It is all the more important to trace the emergence and development of human pathogens more precisely, on the one hand by collecting genomic data from historical samples and, on the other hand, by observing viruses in wild animals more intensively.\n",

            " \"The pictures from downtown Stuttgart cannot leave us cold,\" says Kretschmann. Now facts and insights would have to be gathered and clarified with high pressure who is behind it. Baden-Württemberg's interior minister Thomas Strobl (CDU) wants to act against the rioters with the full harshness of the rule of law. A 40-person investigation team has been set up at the Stuttgart Police Headquarters, and the State Criminal Police Office will support the investigation. He will inform the state parliament in a special session of the interior committee on Wednesday morning before the plenary session, said Strobl. Stuttgart's mayor Fritz Kuhn (Greens) had previously strongly condemned the riots. \"One thing must be clear: there must be no lawless rooms in Stuttgart,\" he said on Sunday morning on Twitter. \"I am shocked by the outbreak of violence, the attacks on the police and the destruction in our city. It is a sad Sunday for Stuttgart.\" Dozens of violent small groups had started rampaging in the city around midnight, injuring more than a dozen police officers. The officials were \"attacked, attacked and injured extremely aggressively,\" a police press release said. The massive attacks were triggered by a police check on the occasion of a drug offense. As a result, people showed solidarity with those controlled, moved towards Schlossplatz and spread out in groups in the city center. The rioters had hit bars and poles on standing patrol cars with bars and posts and smashed windows. Large stones and other objects, including cobblestones that had previously been torn from the ground, were hurled at police vehicles passing by. Several shops in the city center were apparently damaged indiscriminately. Video sequences showed how the perpetrators, some of whom were wearing balaclavas, tried to smash large windows. Expenses were stolen from an as yet undetermined number of transactions. The criminal police are currently securing evidence and have temporarily arrested more than 20 people. According to the police, the situation had calmed down on Sunday morning. The majority of the approximately 200 emergency services who had been summoned to the state capital from other parts of Baden-Württemberg have therefore left Stuttgart.\n",

            " Federal Family Minister Franziska Giffey (SPD) has shown openly on Thursday to allow the retention of data in investigations into cases of sexual violence against children. You have reached a point where you have to check and do everything that is necessary and possible to clarify these things, said Giffey in the ZDF program \"Maybrit Illner\" on Thursday evening. \"And if data retention is an issue that goes with it, we have to look at it, and then we have to do it.\" When storing data, Internet providers are legally obliged to store users' IP addresses so that investigators can access them later. This way you can find out which subscriber is behind an IP address. After the Interior Ministers' Conference in Erfurt, Mecklenburg-West Pomerania's Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier (CDU), as spokesman for the Union-led interior ministries, pleaded for the introduction of data retention on Friday. Federal Interior Minister Seehofer (CSU) also described the data retention in Erfurt as \"indispensable in the fight against child pornography\". It can be used to identify and persecute perpetrators and prevent further terrible acts, Seehofer said on Friday. BKA President Holger Münch had also requested data retention in the past. After the abuse in Münster, however, the role of youth welfare offices and local judges comes into focus. According to SPIEGEL research, these would have had the opportunity to intervene earlier against the main suspect and possibly prevent abuse. In this case, as far as is known, technical problems due to data not saved by Internet providers were not an obstacle to investigations. The civil rights organization Digitalcourage warned of plans to reintroduce \"indiscriminate data retention\". The Münster case would neither confirm the benefit nor the proportionality of the remedy. The FDP described the procedure as the wrong instrument in the fight against child abuse. \"Instead of storing the data of millions of German citizens, one should create a regulation with which event-specific and specific suspicions are saved,\" said FDP interior politician Konstantin Kuhle on Friday.

            " SPD chairwoman Saskia Esken had already reacted to the comments of her SPD colleague Franziska Giffey on Thursday evening. On Twitter, she wrote that she opposed data retention. With regard to a case at the European Court of Justice, she wrote that she assumed that the indefinite storage was not compatible with European fundamental rights. Data retention in Germany is currently suspended. As a result, Internet providers only save IP addresses for a few days. Data retention has been the subject of controversy for years, especially with regard to data protection. The European Court of Justice (ECJ) overturned German law in one ruling in 2016. The ECJ justified the ruling with the fact that a general and reasonless storage of user data with Internet providers violated several fundamental rights such as the protection of personal data and was not proportionate. The Federal Administrative Court returned the final clarification to the ECJ to the ECJ in September 2019 as to whether data retention may be used in Germany. As long as the open questions have not been clarified, data retention will not be implemented in Germany.\n",

            " Bernd Holthusen, born in 1962, is a political scientist. Since 1997 he has been working at the German Youth Institute in Munich, where he heads the specialist group on offers and addressees for child and youth welfare. He has researched child delinquency, juvenile delinquency and its prevention as well as the realities of life of young refugees. SPIEGEL: During the riots in Stuttgart, more than 20 police officers were injured, and numerous patrol cars and businesses were partially damaged. Are we dealing with a new dimension of street violence? Holthusen: We are dealing with a drastic event, the city has probably never experienced anything like it. Like many others, I saw a video in which a hooded person jumps into a police officer and brings him to the ground. That is staggering. But violence against law enforcement has also existed in Germany before. And we should not allow ourselves to be overwhelmed by the abundance of images on social media, but rather wait and see for the assessment of the results that the investigation will bring to light. SPIEGEL: The riot is said to have been caused by the police control of a 17-year-old as part of a drug crime. Around 200 people showed solidarity, the officials attacked. Then the group grew to up to 500 people, bottles and stones flew, there was looting. How do you explain this escalation? Holthusen: As a rule, various factors set such a dynamic in motion: It is late in the evening. A large group of mostly male and young people meet in a relatively small space. Maybe one or the other feels curled by the corona restrictions, is annoyed by the increased police presence. Lots of alcohol is consumed - a classic trigger for acts of violence and escalations. SPIEGEL: Why did the police need hours to get the situation under control? Holthusen: The emergency services got into the situation unprepared. Unlike demonstrations or rioting hooligans in the stadium, they did not expect the escalation, they were surprised. This also promotes dynamism: as soon as the police show themselves weak, temporarily withdraw, that is an incentive for rioters to continue. There were a lot of young people who moved relatively quickly with their anti-corona masks, partially protecting them from anonymity. In this situation, police officers can hardly distinguish between who is a threat and who is not. SPIEGEL: The Baden-Württemberg State Police President Stefanie Hinz has so far been unable to identify any political or religious motives for the riot. It locates those involved in the party and event scene, which has been meeting in public for weeks and staging on social media. Holthusen: So far, no indications have emerged that the riots were planned in some form beforehand. I assume that within the heterogeneous group of 500, many acted very differently. A few will have deliberately exploited the situation to let out their aggressions and commit acts of violence. Others to get a new phone. And then there are the so-called bystanders on the margins, who do not actively intervene in the action, but are happy that something is finally going on. They make cell phone videos that they post on the net because it's spectacular, total action. It is very difficult for police officers on duty to differentiate between these different groups. SPIEGEL: Do you think that the barrier to violence against police officers has generally dropped? Holthusen: No, I don't think so. The individual cases only get greater public attention, also through a newly created criminal offense. I also think that debates about higher sentences are senseless, because experience has shown that they do not deter. Under what circumstances a dangerous bodily harm leads to a year or two youth sentence, adolescents do not know. And in a spontaneous situation with escalating group dynamics, they don't consider possible consequences for the future. At most, the subjective risk of detection and arrest plays a role. SPIEGEL: According to current knowledge, around half of the 26 arrested were immigrants. Could the debate about racism and police violence have played a role in the events of Stuttgart? Holthusen: We can only say that if we know more about the background and the actors. Ten years ago I would have ruled out that public discourse from the United States would manifest itself here in the evening riots in Stuttgart. But thanks to global media networking, things are different today. I know that young people with a migrant background feel discriminated against by police officers in Germany and report relevant experiences. Nevertheless, we have very different conditions in this country than in the USA. What happened in Stuttgart is in a different league. Tristesse after the rioting night in Stuttgart SPIEGEL: Could it be that police officers in the corona crisis have become the new enemy of young people? Because they are perceived as annoying controllers, as spoilers of fun and games? Holthusen: Young people have largely been forgotten in the Corona debate. If at all, it was about their schooling, but not about their living conditions and the cuts in everyday life. But what happens to young people when suddenly they can no longer do what all teenagers do? Be unreasonable, have fun, party. You then look for the most diverse forms of coping and processing. SPIEGEL: You report close-meshed corona controls in Bavaria, where young people also had to pay fines. Holthusen: Sometimes teenagers should pay 150 euros just because they sat together on a park bench. A young person may find this disproportionate, especially if he doesn't have a lot of money. In general, the perspective of disadvantaged young people has hardly been examined. They live in small apartments, without a garden or distraction, because youth centers or sports clubs are closed. These young people meet outside due to a lack of alternatives. Perhaps for this reason, too, more young people were traveling around Stuttgart than usual. SPIEGEL: Will we see comparable riots more often in the future? Holthusen: You cannot rule it out. But the police will now be much more cautious and better prepared. If emergency services are more present from the start, escalations like in Stuttgart can be avoided. SPIEGEL: And beyond that? Holthusen: With all the caution that a pandemic requires, we should look at everyday life and the needs of young people and think about how we can enable them to live out their youth even in the corona crisis.\n",

            " Lack of cooperation, arbitrariness, missing data: After the massive corona outbreak at the meat processor Tönnies, North Rhine-Westphalia's Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) sharply criticized the industry giant - and imposed a lockdown on the Gütersloh district by June 30. According to Laschet, the same rules apply to residents of the Gütersloh district as during the ban on contact in March. If necessary, orders will also be enforced. The corona outbreak in the slaughterhouse is the largest single infection in Germany to date. More than 1550 Tönnies employees tested positive for the virus. Outside the company environment, there are currently 24 people in the Gütersloh district, where around 365,000 people live. The state also announced restrictions for the Warendorf district. Around 7,000 Tönnies employees and their families have been in quarantine for several days. According to Laschet, the center of the Corona outbreak near Tönnies is in meat cutting. In this department there are the most infected. Rheda-Wiedenbrück: A soldier from the German armed forces in front of the building of the Tönnies meat factory. The Prime Minister has trouble making forecasts. If the numbers of infected people outside the slaughterhouse staff remained low, there could soon be a return to normal. An extension of the lockdown is also conceivable. The CDU politician emphasized that there was no ban on departure. But he appealed to the citizens, \"now do not go out of the circle into other circles\". Contact restrictions apply as in March: Only people from your own household or two people from different households may meet in public space. Starting this Wednesday, it is forbidden to do public sports in closed rooms. Gyms and swimming pools remain closed, as do cinemas and bars. Outdoor grilling is prohibited again. Concerts and other events may not take place. Exhibitions and museums have to close again. Schools and daycare centers in the Gütersloh district had already been closed on June 17. The Tönnies company is no longer allowed to produce meat. The quarantine measure for employees and factory representatives of the company is closely monitored. Mobile teams are accompanied by the police and interpreters for Polish, Romanian and Bulgarian. In the Gütersloh district, the tests in the population are to be massively expanded. The police are to accompany mobile test teams. The state government has already deployed three deployments to the Gütersloh district. The police should control the quarantine of Tönnies employees. Orders would have to be enforced if necessary, it said. There will be additional humanitarian measures to support those affected. Around 365,000 people are now living in lockdown again, while the rest of Germany is increasingly returning to normal. A local lockdown is a tried and tested means of keeping the pandemic under control until a vaccine is developed. As a result, places where there are hardly any new infections with Sars-CoV-2 are not plunged into an economic and social crisis by massive restrictions. The fact that a lockdown in principle helps to prevent the virus from spreading has been shown in recent months: \"We have seen that the measures in Germany worked very well at the beginning of the pandemic,\" said RKI boss Lothar Wieler. So it is possible to keep new infections with Sars-CoV-2 low, even without a vaccine. \"But the virus will not disappear completely from Germany.\" A well-known example of the role that hotspots play in the spread of Sars-CoV-2 is the Austrian ski resort of Ischgl, which also has numerous infection chains in Germany. Tourists had been infected in Ischgl and then carried the virus to their home town and spread it there. The question now is whether the measures in Gütersloh will come in time - or whether Tönnies employees have already spread the virus without knowing it. The health authorities also play an important role in this, because they track contacts and inform those affected. In the debate on the causes of the severe outbreak at Tönnies, RKI boss Wieler did not want to commit himself. The cramped living conditions of many employees from Eastern Europe and work in refrigerated operating rooms are currently being discussed as possible reasons. Initial studies indicate that meat farms are the ideal place for the corona virus. This means that the pathogen can clearly last longer in cold surroundings. In addition, the risk of transmission through so-called aerosols - tiny droplets that may remain in the air for hours and can contain infectious viruses - increases in the cooled-down halls. (Read more about this here.) NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU): reacted to the Corona outbreak at Tönnies in good time? For Armin Laschet, the regional lockdown for the Gütersloh district was the only answer to the skyrocketing number of infections. The only question is: does the Prime Minister pull the emergency brake in time? Whether the virus from Gütersloh has not been passed on for a long time and the infection process has thus been rekindled will probably not be known for a week or two. The situation is delicate for Laschet: when the Corona curve flattened in Germany, the CDU vice-president had taken the lead in the easing movement. Now it was noticeably difficult for him to crack down and make himself unpopular with the electorate with new restrictions that he believed had long since been overcome.

As part of the new anti-corona measures, the Prime Minister of North Rhine-Westphalia warned against putting people from the Gütersloh district under general suspicion. One should not \"stigmatize the residents of the district,\" said Laschet. On Monday, the authorities on the holiday island of Usedom asked 14 people from Corona risk areas to leave prematurely. A couple from Gütersloh should also leave the island. A spokesman for the Vorpommern-Greifswald district said they should report to their local health department immediately.\n",

            " Two thirds of all students work to have a little more money in their pockets. Or do you have to say after Corona: jobten? Almost 40 percent urgently need the job to survive financially, as the Deutsche Studentenwerk found in its last survey in 2016. That is around a million students. For comparison: only around 400,000 received Bafög on average in each month of 2018, there are no newer numbers. The corona crisis has brought many students into existential problems. Some because mom and dad are on short-time work and can no longer afford the usual monthly transfer, others because the 450-euro job or the working student contract that got them through the month is now gone. A third of students normally work in the catering trade, so it looks sad at the moment. And the budget for those who receive Bafög is often tight: one part is supported by the parents, the other has to or wants to work. Finanztip Hermann-Josef Tenhagen (born in 1963) is the editor-in-chief of \"Finanztip\". The consumer guide is part of the non-profit Finanztip Foundation. \"Finanztip\" is refinanced via so-called affiliate links. More about this here.\n",
            "Tenhagen previously ran the magazine \"Finanztest\" as editor-in-chief for 15 years. After studying politics and economics, he began his journalistic career with the \"daily newspaper\". There he is now the voluntary supervisory board of the cooperative. On SPIEGEL.de, Tenhagen writes weekly about the correct handling of your own money. The federal government is aware of the problem. She dealt with the role of students in the crisis early on. On the one hand, because the universities and schools were largely closed, on the other hand, because some students quickly became systemically important when it came to medical students in the Corona clinics and medical practices. However, the federal government's aid for students is currently - well, let's say - hesitant. The starting point at the Bafög is the clearest. Whether a student receives Bafög depends largely on the income and marital status of her parents. The previous year's income is taken into account. This is currently not appropriate for more than ten million employees who are registered for short-time work, because their current income is often far below it. The Federal Ministry of Education has also recognized this. Students can therefore apply for the Bafög to be updated if their parents' income has dropped significantly due to Corona. And if the parents' income is so low in Corona times that they are now eligible for the Bafög for the first time, then that is also possible. It was only in 2019 that the grand coalition pushed the income limits and allowances for parents up significantly, up to which Bafög can be drawn at all. Since then, significantly more students have been entitled to Bafög. Previously, the number of Bafög recipients had decreased year after year. Also important for Bafög recipients: They usually only get support for a fixed time. If, due to the lost summer semester 2020, the studies cannot be completed within the standard period of study, the BA for the additional semester will not be canceled. In North Rhine-Westphalia, the state government even accepts it as a failed semester in which it was not possible to study successfully, and by decree has extended the individual standard period of study for all students by one semester. The Bafög is also paid one semester longer. Those who are not entitled to state funding can take out a student loan. Around 60,000 did this before Corona. This is possible at favorable conditions with the federally owned KfW development bank. New loans (up to EUR 650 a month) are easier to grant and initially remain interest-free until March 31, 2021. And even the students who took out a loan before the corona crisis automatically benefit from the interest exemption. The Federal Government pays the interest to KfW. New loans have been approved for 340 million euros since May - four times as much as in the same month last year. And then there is the bridging allowance - 100 to 500 euros a month. Free and for students who are really in need. The government only had the software program for the disbursement built, which is why students can only now apply - three months after the outbreak of the corona crisis. Applications will be processed no earlier than next Wednesday. The fact that it takes so long is not the most important thing. Fearing that students could outsmart the system, the government has implemented a number of security measures and has overshot the target: students in need do not only have to provide insurance and demonstrate that they are in need and, for example, have lost their jobs. You must then submit all of your bank statements to all of your bank accounts backwards by February. If individual details are blacked out, the documents are considered incomplete and there is no money. Students must submit this bridging allowance application every month, for a maximum of June, July and August. The amount of money that is available depends on how much money is in the student's accounts the day before the application. If the account shows less than 100 euros, there are 500 euros for the month, if there are more than 500 euros, the students receive nothing. If the application is accepted, the payment should not take more than a week. At this point you will find an external content that complements the article.

            " So keeping cash is important. If you submit the application and there is still too much money in the account, there is less help. If you submit the application too late, there may be a lot of help in ten days, but before that, a direct debit goes back because of a shortage - with corresponding costs. Planning security does not bring all of that. At the Studentenwerk, it is expected that up to 200,000 students could actually be financially in need. Perhaps this is why the ministry believes it can get by with 100 million euros in bridging money. The students themselves expect a million needy students and demand a billion euros in bridging aid. They want to demonstrate in Berlin on Saturday. The truth is probably in between. In any case, 31,200 students applied for bridging assistance in the first 24 hours. I think the students' anger is understandable. When some of them were urgently needed in the hospital, every compromise was right to make personnel recruitment possible. Now they are no longer in demand, and the wallet is closed. With a little luck, a learning curve will emerge, the young people must first make themselves indispensable, indispensable. Then it is easier with the demands. But what do you do until then? Tapping the pots properly, of course. For Bafög recipients: Request a new Bafög calculation if the parents have closed their shop or are on short-time work. What is special about the Bafög: At least half of it is free. Those who do not receive a student loan can apply for housing benefit. The applications are certainly a challenge, but the money is given for free. It quickly goes from 100 to 200 euros a month. Students who lost their jobs were also able to let the rent go for hours - now possibly even until the end of September. In the dormitories as well as with private landlords. The loss of rent at the student unions currently amounts to up to 20 percent. This also applies to foreign students with a place in the dormitory who were unable to enter the country, students who have moved back in with mom and dad in need. Or students who simply exercised their right to defer rent. An application for bridging assistance certainly does no harm, see above. Just like the student loan from KfW: it allows concentration on the degree. And with a degree in your pocket, it is still easier and better for you to earn money as an academic than without a degree. Don't let it get you down! The future lies ahead of you, dear students.\n",

            " This article will be updated continuously. Don't miss anything: Subscribe to our Coronavirus newsletter for the latest developments and key background information. 11:10 p.m .: As the number of infections increases rapidly, the US state of Texas is putting further easing of the coronavirus restrictions on hold. Governor Greg Abbott said Thursday that further phases of the reopening will be suspended for now. Previous loosening would not be reversed. \"As we see an increase in Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations, we are focusing on strategies to slow the spread of the virus while allowing Texans to make money for their families,\" said the Republican Party politician, President Donald Trump. \"Closing business is the last thing we want as a state.\" The current pause in corona loosening will help curb the spread of the virus, Abbott said. The governor called on the population to wear protective masks, to wash their hands regularly and to observe distance rules. Texas and a number of other US states are currently experiencing the highest number of new coronavirus infections since the crisis began. 10.45 p.m .: Israel and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) want to deepen their cooperation on medical projects in the face of the coronavirus pandemic. According to the Reuters news agency, two companies from the UAE and two Israeli companies will collaborate on medical projects. Initially, only Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced unilaterally. Later, Reuters also reported a confirmation from the UAE with reference to a confirmation from the state news agency WAM. Cooperation could, however, improve relations between Israel and the Arab states. According to Reuters, Israel has no diplomatic relations with the states in the Gulf region. However, there were again points of contact because of the common concern about Iran's attempt to expand its regional influence. 9.45 p.m .: Large parts of the greater Lisbon area have to go into the lockdown again for two weeks on July 1st. This was announced by the Portuguese Prime Minister António Costa. The residents of the 19 affected municipalities in the metropolitan area will therefore only be allowed to go out of the house to make purchases, drive to work or see a doctor. During this time, only meetings of a maximum of five people will be permitted there. The districts in the center of Lisbon are not affected. \"The only effective way to control the pandemic is to keep people at home for as long as possible, always respecting social distance, and all protection and hygiene standards,\" said Costa. In total, there are more than 40,000 proven infections with the novel corona virus in Portugal and more than 1,500 deaths related to the disease Covid-19. According to the Reuters news agency, there are still several hundred new infections every day due to local outbreaks in poorer districts and industrial areas of Lisbon, as well as parties at the coast. 9:15 p.m .: The number of employees in a doner meat production in Moers near Duisburg who tested positive for the corona virus increased to 79. After initially 17 employees had tested positive, 62 were added to further tests, as the Wesel district announced. A total of around 200 employees who were present on Wednesday had cut back after the 17 cases became known. According to the information, 120 results are still pending. The company has 275 employees. Contact tracking is in full swing, the district said. So far, none of the people who tested positive had the typical corona symptoms. Some of the infected people also live outside the Wesel district, including in Duisburg. On Friday, the processing of the raw meat still available is to be completed in the kebab shop. \"After that, the business will be completely closed,\" said the district. Operations had largely been stopped on Wednesday. 8:25 pm: According to a media report, a Bulgarian employee who has returned home after the massive infection with the corona virus in a slaughter factory of the Tönnies company is infected with the corona virus. The test for the virus was positive, said the mayor of Beliza, southwest Bulgaria, Radoslaw Rewanski, the TV station bTV. The man and his family had been tested again for the corona virus after their return home because they were said not to have known the results of the tests in Germany. Antibodies against the coronavirus were therefore detected in the daughter of the infected person. The family of three are now in quarantine in Beliza. Bulgaria wants to find all Tönnies employees who have returned from Germany, according to the dpa news agency, in order to avoid a possible further spread of the corona virus. According to the dpa, however, the authorities at the border do not find out who comes from where, unless the travelers themselves state this. Incoming people from Germany no longer have to be in quarantine in Bulgaria. A total of 4,242 coronavirus cases were identified in the country that has been relatively poorly affected by the pandemic to date. 209 people died. 5.44 p.m .: The economics ministers of the federal states have spoken out in favor of extending short-time work benefits to 24 months. The department heads followed Bremen's request at a video conference on Thursday that Federal Minister Peter Altmaier (CDU) should campaign for the extension in the Federal Government. \"Both employees and companies would benefit from such a regulation,\" said Bremen State Senator Kristina Vogt (Die Linke), chair of the Minister for Economic Affairs. Basically, there is currently a time limit for short-time work benefits to a maximum of twelve months. In certain cases, the subscription period can already be extended to up to 21 months. The conference, which Altmaier also attended, also dealt with bridging aids in the context of the corona pandemic. Altmaier showed great understanding for the continuation of the aid, but only announced the prospect of a decision on the topic at the beginning of August. \"If we want to save the companies in the event industry, we cannot stop helping now,\" warned Vogt. 4:50 p.m .: Tourists from Germany will be able to travel to Tunisia again this Saturday without restrictions or prior corona tests. The Tunisian government put the Federal Republic on a list of countries in which the risk of infection with the corona virus is low, as the Ministry of Health in Tunis announced on Thursday. This also applies to Austria and Switzerland. The Tunisian government declared the corona virus defeated in mid-June. She is now hoping for a revival in the tourism sector, which is central to the Tunisian economy. The country particularly relies on German vacationers. The Federal Government has not classified Tunisia as the only country in North Africa as a risk area. 4.40 pm: Fewer and fewer tulips from Amsterdam: The corona pandemic has caused the flower export of the Netherlands to collapse. In April, the export of cut flowers and 35 percent of bulbs and garden plants fell by 18 percent compared to the same month last year, the country's statistics agency said on Thursday. In contrast, the export of fruit and vegetables remained stable, which is also important for the economy of the neighboring country. While vegetable exports decreased by only one percent, fruit exports rose by two percent in April. Tulip growers in the Netherlands (archive recording) 4:35 pm: So far, tens of thousands of students have applied for emergency aid because of the corona crisis. According to the German Student Union on Thursday, 58,000 applications have been received so far. If all were approved, the total would be 24.5 million euros. A total of EUR 100 million in bridging aid is available from the federal government for the months of June, July and August. 4.30 p.m .: Singapore is rigid in the fight against the corona virus. Six foreigners were denied work permits. The Ministry of Labor announced. A total of seven people had previously pleaded guilty in court to violating Corona contact restrictions in bars and restaurants in the Robertson Quay nightlife district. 4:00 p.m .: Great Britain is most severely affected by the corona pandemic in Europe. Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government is accused of reacting too late and incorrectly to the crisis. For many Britons, the virus no longer appears to be dangerous: at temperatures above 30 degrees, the hottest day of the year so far, thousands of people were drawn to the beaches on the island. According to media reports, the British government wants to offer so-called airlifts for air travel to holiday countries with a low risk of corona infection from July 4th. This is intended to circumvent the 14-day quarantine for passengers returning to the UK. Critics also point out that it may be the British who are introducing the virus to other countries. Crowded beach in Bournemouth 3:15 p.m .: Visitors from German corona hotspots such as the Gütersloh district in North Rhine-Westphalia may have to expect quarantine in Hamburg in the future. A corresponding adaptation of the regulation to contain the pandemic is currently being examined in the Senate, said a spokesman for the health authority of the German Press Agency. A decision should be made next Tuesday. The city's Corona Ordinance currently only provides quarantine regulations for incoming travelers from abroad. Anyone who has been in a risk area classified by the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) at any time within 14 days before entering the Hanseatic city is obliged to go straight to a two-week quarantine at home. The authorities must also be informed immediately. 2.30 p.m .: The European Medicines Agency EMA has given the green light for an active ingredient for corona therapy in the EU for the first time. According to the recommendation, certain Covid-19 patients should be allowed to be treated with remdesivir under certain conditions, as the EMA announced in Amsterdam on Thursday. The EU Commission still has to agree, but this is a matter of form. The EMA recommendation applies to the treatment of adults and adolescents from the age of 12. A prerequisite for treatment is that the patient has pneumonia and must be supplied with additional oxygen. An international study with over 1,000 participants showed at the end of April that remdesivir in Covid 19 patients could reduce the time to recovery by an average of four days - from 15 to 11 days. Mortality decreased slightly in the study, but was not statistically significant. The United States had already granted an exemption for the limited use of the active ingredient in hospitals at the beginning of May. In Germany, too, the drug was previously accessible within a drug hardship program and is being tested in clinical studies. 1.35 p.m .: The states of Berlin and Bremen are pushing for an increase in short-time work benefits to help employees who are particularly hard hit by the corona crisis. For net income of up to 1400 euros, the amount should be increased to 90 percent, said the Berlin Senate Department for Labor and Social Affairs as one of the demands. For net income between more than 1400 euros and 1700 euros, it should rise to 85 percent. With net income over 1700 euros, the short-time work allowance should amount to 80 percent of the net income. The rates should be 7 percent higher for employees with at least one child. The regulation is to apply retroactively from March 1 to March 31, 2021. The federal states have decided to introduce a motion for a resolution with their demands to the Federal Council. 1:07 p.m .: Germany will increase its financial support for the World Health Organization (WHO) to more than 500 million euros this year in the corona crisis. That was announced by Health Minister Jens Spahn (CDU) during a visit to Geneva. \"This is the highest amount that Germany has ever paid to the WHO in one year,\" said Spahn. In addition to the roughly 110 million euros that Germany has already promised to contain the coronavirus, the WHO would be provided with 200 million euros. This support has yet to be approved by parliament, but the government is very confident that it will happen in early July, Spahn said. In addition, an additional 41 million euros would be paid for WHO's main tasks. Masks and medical devices such as respirators would also be provided. That should be understood as a strong sign of international solidarity. \"We stand together to tackle global health problems,\" said Spahn. National solo efforts to deal with international problems are doomed to fail. In general, Germany remains a strong supporter and critical friend of the organization. 12.40 p.m .: Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier has warned against reckless behavior in view of the dangers posed by the corona virus. \"The corona pandemic is not over yet,\" he said at an event at Bellevue Palace. \"The development in the hotspots shows that we are still moving on very, very thin ice.\" For the first time since the outbreak of the pandemic, the Federal President and his wife Elke Büdenbender had invited to an event in the \"Coffee Table\" series. For security reasons, this took place in the park of Schloss Bellevue. Steinmeier and Büdenbender discussed with their guests \"Restrictions in the corona crisis: dark sides and bright spots\". 12:26: In Austria, prostitution, which has been banned in the meantime due to the corona crisis, is again permitted from July 1. The Ministry of Health of the Austrian news agency APA confirmed that brothels and walkways can be entered again. The Ministry is currently working on recommendations for hygiene and protection together with representatives from advice centers, for example. Around 8,000 sex workers are registered in Austria. They were particularly hard hit financially by the corona crisis and were entitled to benefits from the hardship fund as self-employed. \"We welcome the fact that sex work is allowed again,\" said Eva van Rahden, head of an advice center for sex workers in Vienna. \"Some women have already made appointments with customers.\" 12.21 p.m .: The United Nations is expecting an increase in global drug use due to the corona crisis. From rising unemployment to savings in prevention programs and fewer drug raids, the United Nations Office for Drugs and Crime (UNODC) cited a variety of reasons for its forecast in its World Drugs Report 2020 published in Vienna on Thursday. \"The Covid-19 crisis and the economic downturn threaten to further increase drug threats,\" warned UNODC chief Ghada Waly. After all, the corona pandemic has brought health and social systems \"to the brink\" of their resilience. All governments should now \"show greater solidarity and support, especially developing countries, to fight illicit drug trafficking\". The UNODC report warns that governments may cut their drug budgets due to the economic consequences of the corona crisis. They may also place less emphasis on drug detection and international cooperation in this area, thereby facilitating drug trafficking. At the same time, the report threatens to increase the number of potential drug users and drug traffickers due to the corona crisis. Unemployment and lack of prospects increased the likelihood that \"poor and disadvantaged people (...) would engage in illegal drug-related activities - either production or transportation\". According to the UN experts, the trend should go to cheap drugs that are injected because of the crisis. This form of taking harbors even more risks than taking drugs, for example in tablet form, among other things because contaminated syringes can infect people with diseases such as AIDS. There are currently fewer drugs in circulation due to the reintroduction of border controls and other corona restrictions. This means that drugs are sold more expensive and with a lower degree of purity. The corona crisis may lead to an increase in drug trafficking in the anonymous darknet and via mail. In its report, the UNODC emphasizes that global drug use has increased recently - especially in developing countries. For example, the market for metamphetamines is growing in Afghanistan and Iraq. Global cocaine production has reached a new all-time high. The most widely used drug, according to the report, is cannabis. In 2018, it was consumed by 192 million people worldwide. The drugs that do the most damage are still opioids like heroin or fentanyl. According to the UNODC, they are consumed by 58 million people worldwide. 12:09 p.m .: After months of decreasing infection numbers in Europe, the continental coronavirus is on the rise again, according to the regional office of the World Health Organization (WHO). 30 countries in the European region have reported increasing case numbers over the past two weeks, said WHO regional director Hans Kluge at his weekly online press conference in Copenhagen. This is the first increase in weekly new infections in Europe in months. Countries such as Germany, Spain, Poland and Israel, however, had reacted quickly to the dangerous outbreaks associated with schools, coal mines and food producers, said Kluge. \"Wherever new clusters appeared, they were checked by quick and targeted interventions - that's very good news.\" Praise goes to the authorities involved. The pandemic is currently continuing to accelerate worldwide and peaked in corona cases on Sunday, when more than 183,000 confirmed new infections were reported within 24 hours, said Kluge. The percentage of Europe is decreasing. Nevertheless, there are almost 20,000 new infections and more than 700 deaths in the region every day. The WHO counts 53 countries in the European region. In addition to the EU member states, ex-EU member Great Britain and the countries of the European Free Trade Association, this also includes Russia, the Balkans and other nations. 11:51: In the North American professional professional league NBA there are three more Corona cases before the restart. Malcolm Brogdon from Indiana Pacers and Jabari Parker and Alex Len from Sacramento Kings tested positive for COVID-19 in preparation for the rest of the season. This was announced by their clubs and players on social networks. On Tuesday, the corona infection of Serbian Nikola Jokic from the Denver Nuggets had become public. \"I have recently tested positive for corona virus and am currently in quarantine,\" said Point Guard Brogdon: \"I am fine and feeling good. I am planning to join my teammates in Orlando to resume the regular season and.\" to play with them. \" The 27-year-old had most recently taken part in the protests after George Floyd's police-induced death. 11:38: The corona pandemic claimed its first fatality on the stadium construction sites for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. The organizers confirmed this on Thursday. According to this, a 51-year-old specialist engineer without previous illnesses died from COVID-19. There have been a total of 1102 corona cases at the stadium construction sites for the Winter World Cup, of which 121 construction workers are still infected. The organizers had recently tightened the security measures and hygiene rules after growing public criticism in consultation with the Qatar government. Accordingly, the construction workers must now wear mouth and nose protection, and certain minimum clearances must be maintained both on the construction sites and during the bus trips to the stadiums. Workers on the construction site for a stadium in Al-Khor, around 60 kilometers north of Doha 10.55 a.m .: After a campaign rally by US President Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma at the weekend, the Secret Service apparently ordered self-isolation for dozens of employees involved. Previously, two employees who were present in Tulsa had tested positive for the coronavirus, the broadcaster CNN reported. To protect privacy and \"operational security,\" the Secret Service will not release figures, the Washington Post quoted a spokeswoman. The agency, which is responsible, among other things, for the protection of the president, is still able to fulfill its tasks, it said. Trump had received criticism of holding an event with thousands of people in a closed arena amidst the ongoing pandemic. He had announced in advance that almost a million people had applied for tickets to the event in the approximately 19,200 arena. In fact, thousands of places remained empty, possibly an action by young social media users. 10.30 a.m .: Panama's Minister of Health Rosario Turner has to vacate her post. Her previous deputy Luis Sucre will take over the office, head of state Laurentino Cortizo said on Twitter. The minister had been criticized for having co-organized a party meeting with more than 30 participants in a restaurant last week and was said to have violated corona rules, the newspaper \"La Prensa\" reported. In March, she wrote that she herself ordered the restaurants to be closed. The ministers for social development, Markova Concepción, and for housing and spatial planning, Inés Samudio, are also leaving the cabinet. Concepción is to become the new Panamanian ambassador to the United Nations. 10.20 a.m .: In Russia, the number of infections increased to 613,994. According to the authorities, 7113 new infections were detected within 24 hours - slightly less than the day before with 7176 new cases. The number of deaths related to the coronavirus increased by 92 to a total of 8605. The previous day, 154 other deaths had been registered. 10:00 am: Visitors can now go back to the Eiffel Tower. Strict hygiene and security measures have been taken to reopen the Parisian landmark. Until the beginning of July, visitors can only reach the 324 meter tower by stairs. For security reasons, lifts are initially blocked. In addition, visitors are not allowed to go higher than the second floor of the tower, and people over the age of 11 are required to wear a face covering. View of the Eiffel Tower (archive photo) The number of daily visitors is limited, according to the operating company. Interested parties must reserve their ticket in advance online. The more than three-month closure of the Eiffel Tower due to the corona pandemic is \"the longest since the Second World War,\" said the operating company. With almost 30,000 deaths, France is severely affected by the pandemic. 9.30 a.m .: The Rhineland-Palatinate state parliament canceled the plenary session scheduled for Thursday due to a suspected Corona case. After the plenary session on Wednesday, it became known that a member of the state parliament was the contact person for a person suffering from Covid-19, the state parliament announced on Thursday morning. The parliamentarian was therefore tested for the corona virus, a result is expected in the evening. 9.16 a.m .: Baden-Württemberg also no longer wants travelers from the North Rhine-Westphalian Corona risk area to stay overnight in the country. The ban on accommodation for visitors from a city or district with an increased infection rate should come into force quickly. The state ministry in Stuttgart announced that it would apply as soon as the ordinance was announced by the ministry of social affairs and the economy. 9.00 a.m .: The North Rhine-Westphalian Minister of Health Karl-Josef Laumann (CDU) can not rule out that some Tönnies employees have not been tested for Corona. It could be that \"we 20, 30 went through the rags,\" said Laumann in a special meeting of the health committee on Thursday. But he defended the actions of the authorities: It had been \"carefully tested by the public sector\". Laumann's State Secretary Edmund Heller made it clear at the meeting that it was initially hardly possible to record the people on the Tönnies site retrospectively. 8.55 a.m .: After the Corona outbreak in the Gütersloh area in North Rhine-Westphalia, Lower Saxony's Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) defended the restrictions imposed on vacationers from this region. \"These are already numbers that clearly exceed the other conditions,\" said the head of government about the high infection numbers in the Gütersloh and Warendorf districts. In Lower Saxony, tourists from these circles will soon only be able to stay in hotels, holiday apartments or campsites with a medical certificate. Both in Gütersloh and in Warendorf the limit agreed by the federal and state governments of 50 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants is clearly exceeded within one week. \"In my view, what is happening so far can be justified very, very well,\" said Weil. With the restrictions, Lower Saxony followed the assessment of the North Rhine-Westphalian state government. In his view, the switch from a general lockdown to a concentrated regional control has proven itself, Weil said. 8.47 a.m .: Harry Glawe, Minister of Health from Mecklenburg-West Pomerania, will in future require tourists from risk areas to have a negative corona test that is no older than 48 hours. The risk area includes counties or independent cities that have 50 or more cases per 100,000 inhabitants within seven days. \"This certificate must be submitted to the competent authority immediately upon request,\" a ministry press release said. Not only Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, also Schleswig-Holstein is tightening the rules for tourists. Vacationers from corona hotspots must be quarantined in Schleswig-Holstein for two weeks, unless they have a negative corona test. The test must not be older than 48 hours. In Saxony-Anhalt, Prime Minister Rainer Haseloff does not want to rule out possible restrictions for tourists from high-risk areas. \"I do not want to hide the fact that we will adopt a new regulation next Tuesday in the cabinet - and that we are currently considering very strongly to include a so-called accommodation ban in this regulation,\" said Haseloff in an interview with \"MDR Aktuell\". The background to the restrictions is several local outbreaks of the corona virus, especially in a slaughterhouse owned by the Tönnies company in North Rhine-Westphalia. There, over 1,500 people have tested positive for the virus in the past few days. 7.40 a.m .: Numerous Nobel Prize winners and pro-democratic organizations from all over the world have warned of the dangers of the corona crisis for democracy. The coronavirus pandemic not only threatens the lives and livelihoods of people worldwide, but is also a political crisis that threatens the future of free democracy, they wrote in an open letter. \"The Covid 19 crisis is an alarming wake-up call and an urgent warning that the freedoms we value are at risk and that we cannot take them for granted.\" Not surprisingly, authoritarian regimes used the situation to silence critics and consolidate their power, the letter said. However, some democratically elected governments also used emergency powers to limit the pandemic, which restricted human rights and expanded state surveillance. Parliaments were ignored, journalists arrested and minorities scapegoated. Suppression will not help bring the pandemic under control. Democracy continues to be the most effective system for dealing with global crises. The letter was initiated by the Stockholm-based intergovernmental democracy institute IDEA and the US organization National Endowment for Democracy. In addition to around 70 organizations, the more than 500 signatories include 13 Nobel Prize winners such as the Nobel Peace Prize winners Frederik Willem de Klerk, Juan Manuel Santos and Lech Walesa as well as almost 60 former heads of state and government and activists such as Joshua Wong from Hong Kong. 7.22 a.m .: Helge Braun, chancellor and trained doctor, has warned against lax handling of the danger of the corona pandemic. \"These larger outbreaks have now shown that the moment you give the virus a chance, it strikes again,\" said the CDU politician on Wednesday evening on the ZDF program \"Markus Lanz\". There has been a phase in the past two or three weeks during which some people have had the impression that the pandemic is almost over. \"We only have a chance of a good economic recovery, including social relaxation ... if the number of infections is very, very low,\" emphasized Braun. That is why the task now is \"to answer every local outbreak very, very precisely and very quickly, but also not to become too carefree\". Recently there had been a major outbreak in the Gütersloh district. More than 1550 employees of the slaughterhouse in the Westphalian town of Rheda-Wiedenbrück were demonstrably infected with the corona virus. The authorities had then massively restricted public life in the district of Gütersloh and in the neighboring district of Warendorf. Around 640,000 people are affected. The state government now intends to use corona mass tests in both circles to find out about the spread of the virus by the end of the week. The schools in the Warendorf district are closing on Thursday, and they have been closed in the Gütersloh district for a few days. Kindergartens are now also closed. Many people from the regions cannot escape so easily on vacation either: negative corona tests are required of them in several popular vacation regions in Germany - otherwise there is sometimes a ban on accommodation. In Bavaria, Schleswig-Holstein and Mecklenburg-West Pomerania, general restrictions for tourists from Corona hotspots were imposed, in Lower Saxony explicitly for the Gütersloh and Warendorf districts. The rush to the Corona test centers should therefore continue to be high in both circles as on Wednesday. Austria immediately issued a travel warning for all of North Rhine-Westphalia and urgently advises its citizens against a trip to the federal state. NRW is thus in line with the Chinese province of Hubei and the Italian Lombardy. 6.46 a.m .: Disneyland should actually reopen in Anaheim, California in July. Nothing is happening now, the reopening has been postponed. The state of California has not yet issued guidelines for the commissioning of theme parks, it said in a message from the group on Wednesday. In Florida, Disney World was reopened for July 11th. Disneyland Paris is scheduled to reopen in phases from July 15th. However, the number of visitors remains limited, it says in a message on the website of the amusement park. For the entertainment giant, business with amusement parks, holiday resorts and cruises is one of the most important sources of revenue. The March corona pandemic closures have cost billions of dollars. 4.50 a.m .: The local health authorities reported 630 corona infections to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) within one day. Since the beginning of the corona crisis, 192,079 people in Germany have been shown to be infected with the corona virus, as the RKI announced (data status: June 25, midnight). According to RKI, 8,927 people infected with the virus died in Germany - an increase of 13 compared to the previous day. RKI estimates that around 176,800 people have survived the infection. That is 500 more than the day before. According to RKI estimates, the number of reproductions was 0.72 (previous day: 2.02). The R value shows the infection process approximately one and a half weeks beforehand. The seven-day R refers to a longer period and is therefore less subject to daily fluctuations. According to RKI estimates, this value fell to 1.17 (previous day: 1.67). It shows the infection from 8 to 16 days ago. 3.55 a.m .: The North Rhine-Westphalian State Criminal Police Office (LKA) is investigating the suspicion that criminal clans may have received state emergency aid from Corona. Es gebe in vereinzelten Fällen Hinweise darauf, dass Clanmitglieder solche Finanzhilfen der Bundesregierung erhalten hätten, sagte der leitende LKA-Kriminaldirektor Thomas Jungbluth der \"Rheinischen Post\". Er betonte aber, dass auch ein Clanmitglied etwa als Betreiber einer Shishabar unter Umständen Anspruch auf die Soforthilfe habe. \"Ein Clan-Angehöriger bleibt grundsätzlich anspruchsberechtigt\", sagte Jungbluth. Die Zugehörigkeit zu einem Familienclan lasse die Anspruchsberechtigung nicht erlöschen. Mit den Soforthilfen will die Bundesregierung durch die Coronakrise in Nöte geratenen Unternehmen und Selbstständigen zügig unter die Arme greifen. In mehreren Bundesländern gehen die Strafverfolgungsbehörden dem Verdacht auf Betrügereien bei Antragstellungen nach. 3.43 Uhr: Laut der jüngsten Hochrechnung des medizinischen Instituts IHME der Universität in Washington steigt die Zahl der Todesopfer in Lateinamerika bis Oktober auf 388.300 steigt. Demnach wird Brasilien voraussichtlich 166.000 und Mexiko 88.000 Tote verzeichnen. Ohne Maßnahmen wie das Tragen von Gesichtsmasken könnte sich im schlimmsten Fall die Zahl der Todesopfer in Brasilien auf 340.476 und in Mexiko auf 151.433 erhöhen, heißt es in dem Bericht. Lateinamerika hat sich zu einem Hotspot der Pandemie entwickelt: Große Armut, dichte Siedlungen und mangelnde Gesundheitsversorgung haben zu einer Verdreifachung der Fälle auf nun zwei Millionen geführt. 3.20 Uhr: Die australische Fluggesellschaft Qantas Airways plant infolge der Coronakrise mindestens 20 Prozent ihrer Belegschaft abzubauen und über Abschreibungen rund 1,3 Milliarden Dollar Liquidität aufzubringen. \"Wir müssen uns für mehrere Jahre positionieren, wenn der Umsatz viel niedriger ausfällt\", sagte Qantas-Chef Alan Joyce. \"Und das bedeutet, kurzfristig eine viel kleinere Fluggesellschaft zu werden.\" Bleiben derzeit am Boden: Die Flieger der Qantas Airways Qantas kündigte an, mindestens 6000 der 29.000 Stellen zu streichen, weitere 15.000 Mitarbeiter blieben vorübergehend freigestellt, bis vor allem der internationale Flugverkehr wieder zunehme. Joyce sagte, dass rund hundert Flugzeuge für bis zu 12 Monate oder länger am Boden bleiben müssten, die sechs in der Flotte verbliebenen Boeing 747 sollen sofort - und nicht wie geplant erst in sechs Monaten - in den Ruhestand geschickt werden. Zudem wolle die Fluggesellschaft über die Abschreibung ihrer derzeit stillgelegten Airbus-A380-Flotte bis zu 1,3 Milliarden Dollar aufbringen, um die Liquidität des Unternehmens zu sichern. Im Rahmen eines Dreijahresplans erklärte sich Joyce bereit, bis mindestens Juni 2023 an der Spitze des Konzerns zu bleiben. Die Regierung in Australien hatte vergangene Woche angekündigt, dass internationale Reisen wahrscheinlich erst wieder im kommenden Jahr möglich sein werden, allerdings werde eine Lockerung der Einreisebestimmungen für Studenten und andere Langzeitbesucher in Betracht gezogen. 1.08 Uhr: Das Coronavirus breitet sich in Brasilien weiter rasant aus. Das Gesundheitsministerium meldete 42.725 Neuinfektionen, damit steigt die Gesamtzahl der Ansteckungen auf knapp 1,2 Millionen. Die Zahl der Todesfälle stieg innerhalb von 24 Stunden um 1185 auf 53.830. Brasilien weist in der Coronavirus-Pandemie nach den USA weltweit die meisten Infektionen und Todesfälle auf. Ganz Südamerika ist schwer von der Coronakrise betroffen, es wird angenommen, dass die Opferzahlen zumindest in Brasilien noch höher als ohnehin angenommen sein könnten. Das legen Berichte von Bestattern und medizinischem Personal nahe, in einzelnen Regionen im brasilianischen Regenwald wurden bereits Massengräber ausgehoben. Kritiker werfen Staatschef Jair Bolsonaro vor, die Gefahren des Coronavirus noch immer zu unterschätzen. Bolsonaro hatte die Pandemie zunächst mit einer \"kleinen Grippe\" verglichen. Noch Mitte Mai hatte er vor Anhängern gesagt, dass man das Coronavirus bald los sei. Seither hat sich das Land zum globalen Zentrum der Pandemie entwickelt. 0.45 Uhr: Nach dem massiven Corona-Ausbruch im Kreis Gütersloh wächst unmittelbar vor Beginn der Sommerreisesaison die Sorge vor einer Verbreitung in anderen Bundesländern. Wie zuvor schon Bayern und Schleswig-Holstein kündigte nun auch Niedersachsen ein Beherbergungsverbot für Touristen aus der Region an. Nach einer Telefonkonferenz der Gesundheitsminister der Länder zeichnet sich jedoch keine bundesweite Regelung ab - anders als in Österreich. Das deutsche Nachbarland sprach eine Reisewarnung für ganz Nordrhein-Westfalen aus. Diese Entscheidung kritisierte Nordrhein-Westfalens Ministerpräsident Armin Laschet (CDU). \"Als in Ischgl mal etwas passiert ist, haben wir nicht eine Reisewarnung für ganz Österreich ausgesprochen\", sagte Laschet der \"Bild\"-Zeitung. \"Ich glaube nicht, dass Gütersloh schlimmer ist als Ischgl.\" 0.15 Uhr: Die USA haben einen weiteren Höchststand an Neuinfektionen mit dem Coronavirus verzeichnet. Am Dienstag wurden rund 34.700 neue Infektionen bestätigt - der höchste Stand seit Ende April und der dritthöchste Tageswert seit Beginn der Pandemie, wie aus Daten der Johns-Hopkins-Universität in Baltimore hervorgeht. In comparison: on June 1, the daily value was around 17,400 new infections. The highest number so far (36,400) was recorded on April 24. Nach anderen Bundesstaaten verzeichnete auch der bevölkerungsreichste US-Bundesstaat Kalifornien die höchste je gemessene Zahl an Neuinfektionen. Governor Gavin Newsom said 7149 new cases were added on Tuesday. The occupancy of the hospitals has increased by almost 30 percent compared to two weeks ago. Newsom called on the nearly 40 million inhabitants to stay at home, keep their distance and wear masks if possible.\n",

            " The corona crisis may make Germans more conscious consumers; in addition, every second wants to spend less money on fashion in the future. These are the results of a survey of more than a thousand fashion consumers by the McKinsey management consultancy, which is available to SPIEGEL. The weeks-long lockdown situation, in which, among other things, the fashion shops had completely closed, left an impression on the Germans. \"People have seen the planet as vulnerable, which leads to caution,\" says McKinsey consultant Karl-Hendrik Magnus. \"In addition, many are impressed by the positive effects of the lockdown on the climate.\" Two-thirds of the respondents stated that it was now even more important for them to limit the effects on climate change. Three quarters say they use fashion items longer and don't want to throw them away as quickly. Consumers say \"novelty\" is one of the least important attributes for fashion purchases. Younger consumers are also more interested in second-hand items. The consultants also found that customers expect companies to get involved in the crisis. Companies that had changed their production to disinfectants or face masks, for example, got away well with them. Consumers also registered how fair individual brands had been to the workers in the textile factories during the crisis. Forever vacation Because of regular business: Why the school chaos continues It is not new that buyers are environmentally conscious in surveys. So far, this has changed little in practice, especially when it comes to fashion. According to consultant Magnus, however, there are now indications that the changed awareness is also reflected in the behavior of consumers. Online retailers found that fashion products that are advertised as sustainable are sold more frequently than before the crisis. \"However, we won't see whether this is a trend that really changes anything before Christmas.\"\n",

            " The corona crisis hits the aviation industry hard, and take-offs and landings were hardly possible for months. Considerable efforts are now required to ensure the survival of the larger airlines. At Lufthansa, the Annual General Meeting on Thursday is about the future of the company. The group recently agreed with the flight attendant union Ufo on a savings package to deal with the consequences of the corona crisis. This includes savings of more than half a billion euros, as Lufthansa announced on Thursday night. The agreements could avoid layoffs for the 22,000 cabin employees during the period of the crisis, the company said. According to the group, it was agreed, among other things, that compensation increases should be suspended and flight hours for employees reduced while reducing their compensation accordingly. Accordingly, contributions to company pensions should be temporarily reduced. Furthermore, voluntary measures such as unpaid leave, further reductions in working hours and promoted, early switching to retirement benefits were agreed. The UFO members still have to agree to the conclusion. Lufthansa Human Resources Director Michael Niggemann described the agreement as an \"important signal\" to the shareholders: \"We want to avoid redundancies in the Lufthansa cabin due to operational reasons\". The group also sees the financial statements \"as a sign of a regained and constructive social partnership with the UFO\". Shareholders should vote on the state rescue package for Lufthansa at their Annual General Meeting on Thursday (from 12 noon). Your approval of the aid, which is worth billions, is considered secure after the major shareholder Heinz Hermann Thiele announced his yes in an interview with the \"Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung\" on Wednesday evening after some hesitation. The state's entry into Lufthansa can only be implemented with the approval of the Annual General Meeting.\n",

            " The long-standing trend towards ever higher education in Germany is apparently reaching its limits: the quota of young people with a high school diploma or technical college entrance has decreased since 2014. In contrast, the number of school leavers who did not achieve at least a secondary school leaving certificate rose during the same period. This shows the new national education report, which was presented in Berlin on Tuesday. Educational researchers from various institutes have compiled numerous data for this. The report is \"a systematic inventory of the entire educational system,\" said Kai Maaz, director of the Leibniz Institute for Educational Research and Educational Information. The most important results: From 2014 to 2019, the proportion of schoolchildren of one age group who obtained their Abitur or technical college entrance qualification fell from 53 to 50 percent. There may be something like a satiety effect on educational needs, educational researcher Maaz said. In 2014, a total of 5.8 percent of young people left school without any qualifications. Five years later, it was significantly more at 6.8 percent. \"The increasing proportion of people without a general education qualification in the population worsens their life prospects in the long term,\" the report says. Men are affected more frequently than women. The researchers positively assess that the permeability in the education system has increased further - albeit at a low level. Early educational decisions such as the choice of secondary school \"can be corrected more easily\": The number of freshmen without a school-leaving qualification rose from 0.4 percent in 2000 to 3.5 percent in 2018. All in all, the educational researchers therefore state a growing need for education. Rising birth rates and immigration gains from abroad \"will lead to an increasing demand for educational offers in the early years in the early education, care and upbringing as well as in the primary and secondary areas of the schools\", the report says. However, this additional need is distributed differently by region: urban regions are particularly affected by the higher demand for education. For other parts of the country, on the other hand, the supply of schools has already deteriorated noticeably: Since 2008, \"numerous vocational schools and primary schools have been closed in the more structurally weaker districts, which are predominantly located in the eastern area,\" the study says. The number of elementary schools there declined by six percent within a decade, and that of vocational schools even by 41 percent. The national education report is funded by the Federal Government and the Conference of Ministers of Education of the federal states and will appear every two years, 2020 for the eighth time. It sees itself as a data-based overview of the entire educational system - from daycare to schools, the training sector and universities to adult education. Action options for educational policy are to be derived from the actual presentation of the system. The educational report is written by independent scientists from different research institutions. Represented are the DIPF - Leibniz Center for Educational Research and Educational Information, the German Institute for Adult Education - Leibniz Center for Lifelong Learning (DIE), the German Youth Institute (DJI), the German Center for University and Science Research (DZHW), Leibniz -Institute for Educational Trajectories (LIfBi), the Sociological Research Institute at the University of Göttingen (SOFI) and the Federal Statistical Office (Destatis) and the federal states. The current education report once again confirmed a coupling that had been observed in Germany for some time: \"The educational success of children is directly related to the socio-economic situation of the family,\" write the scientists, \"depending on socio-economic, migration-specific affiliation, the opportunities for participation in education vary as well by region significantly. \" The decisive factors are the level of education of the parents, possible unemployment of the mother and father and the risk of poverty for the family. Children in single-parent families are particularly at risk of poverty. In other words, the German education system is still far from real equal opportunities. \"The influence of social background on educational success is still far too great,\" said Stefanie Hubig, SPD Minister of Culture in Rhineland-Palatinate and currently President of the Conference of Ministers of Education. This is still one of the most important tasks of educational policy. In general, the educational report for decision-makers in the federal states and in the federal government \"is a task for action in many respects\". A main chapter of this year's report deals with the status of digitization in schools and other educational institutions. The data used for this essentially refer to the year 2019 and thus to the time before the corona pandemic. Kai Maaz emphasized that the report was therefore not a Corona report. However, the current crisis has made it massively clear once again where the structural problems lie: \"Not all people can use the digital possibilities to the same extent,\" says the education report. That depends on the one hand on one's own competences, but on the other hand on the social background: Those who are poor tend to be excluded from digital options - with the corresponding negative consequences for their own educational opportunities. When looking at the digitalization of the education system in Germany, the focus has so far been on technology, on the other hand, educational and didactic ideas are in short supply, the authors write: \"Up to now, there have been no concepts for using didactically meaningful digital technologies along the entire educational biography.\" The use of digitally supported teaching methods \"has not yet been systematically integrated into the training and further education of educational staff,\" the report says. For teachers and other educational actors, it is ultimately a matter of luck whether good or few good training and further education offers are made with regard to digital learning in their respective federal states. \"So far, there has been no convincing and coordinated strategy for education in a digitized world,\" said Kai Maaz. Especially in international comparison, there is a lot of catching up to do in Germany in this regard.\n",

            " Public life is restricted in the district of Gütersloh and in the neighboring district of Warendorf. The reason: a massive coronavirus outbreak in a Tönnies meat factory. At midnight, strict conditions came into force again in the region. What happens now? The overview. Lower Saxony issued a ban on accommodation for tourists from the region. \"The state will apply the regulation already in place in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and Bavaria in the tourism sector to people from the Gütersloh area,\" said government spokeswoman Anke Pörksen in Hanover. A corresponding regulation is currently being developed. It has not yet been decided whether it should generally apply to regions in Germany with an increased number of new corona infections. Other federal states only want citizens from Corona risk areas to enter under strict conditions. In Schleswig-Holstein, they should go into quarantine for two weeks after entering the country. On the island of Usedom, holidaymakers from the Gütersloh district were already asked to leave Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania on Monday. In Bavaria, hotels and holiday apartments will no longer be able to accept people who come from a district in which the number of new infections in the past seven days has been more than 50 per 100,000 inhabitants. Exceptions should only exist for those who could show a current negative corona test. In the district of Gütersloh, the so-called 7-day incidence had recently risen to well over 200. Meanwhile, Austria issued a travel warning for North Rhine-Westphalia. \"In connection with the recent spread of the corona virus, a partial travel warning (security level 5) applies to North Rhine-Westphalia - a warning is given against trips to North Rhine-Westphalia\", said the website of the Austrian Foreign Ministry on Wednesday. Teachers from the Gütersloh and Warendorf area, who teach at schools in Lower Saxony, were asked to stay at home for the time being. \"We are not concerned with discrimination or exclusion of people from North Rhine-Westphalia,\" said government spokeswoman Pörksen. It is about reacting as punctually as possible and protecting the business in Lower Saxony. \"We are trying to react appropriately to the emerging danger.\" At this point you will find an external content that complements the article.

            " With the entry into force of the strict rules, the corona tests in the districts of Gütersloh and Warendorf will be significantly expanded. The police are to accompany mobile test teams. The state government has already deployed three deployments to the Gütersloh district. The police should control the quarantine of Tönnies employees. Orders would have to be enforced if necessary, it said. There will be additional humanitarian measures to support those affected. According to health minister Karl-Josef Laumann (CDU) residents and employees in care facilities, employees of hospitals, employees in the food retail trade and kiosk staff should be tested. This also applies to the employees of companies and subcontractors who operate central shared accommodation or employ a large number of contract workers. In addition, all citizens of both circles should have the opportunity to be tested free of charge. According to the Gütersloh district, more than 1,500 Tönnies employees have been proven to be infected. Around 7000 employees were quarantined before the tests. Contact restrictions apply as in March: Only people from your own household or two people from different households may meet in public space. Starting this Wednesday, it is forbidden to do public sports in closed rooms. Gyms and swimming pools remain closed, as do cinemas and bars. Outdoor grilling is prohibited again. Concerts and other events may not take place. The new restrictions will initially apply for one week through June 30. Exhibitions and museums have to close again. Schools and daycare centers in the Gütersloh district had already been closed on June 17. The Tönnies company is no longer allowed to produce meat. The quarantine measure for employees and factory representatives of the company is closely monitored. Mobile teams are accompanied by the police and interpreters for Polish, Romanian and Bulgarian. Shops and restaurants can remain open. He called the measures \"Lockdown soft or Lockdown light\", said the Gütersloh district administrator Sven-Georg Adenauer (CDU). \"If you compare it to what we had in March, it is something that you can come to terms with. Not that hard, and only limited to one week.\" Around 640,000 inhabitants are affected. With the new restrictions in Gütersloh and in the district of Warendorf, people expect a lot, said North Rhine-Westphalia's Prime Minister Armin Laschet on Wednesday in the state parliament in Düsseldorf. Due to the wide spread of the places of residence and the Tönnies workforce, the outbreak harbors an \"enormous pandemic risk\". No one can say yet how far the virus has spread in the population. \"Weighing is necessary,\" said Armin Laschet in the state parliament about the measures. According to the Ministry of Labor, Health and Social Affairs of North Rhine-Westphalia, more than 1500 positive test results have been reported in the district of Gütersloh. Of these, 1,413 results are based on tests carried out on the Tönnies site. From the other districts of North Rhine-Westphalia - Bochum, Hamm and the Recklinghausen district - seven corona tests were positive until June 23. North Rhine-Westphalia is \"the first country in Germany\" to cautiously \"completely return a region\", said Prime Minister Laschet in the state parliament. Given the criticism that the state government shut down life in the affected circles too late, Laschet said: \"Weighing up is necessary.\" He was always amazed at how quickly some were ready to restrict fundamental rights.\n",

            " The payment service provider Wirecard declared bankruptcy because the balance sheet was missing 1.9 billion euros. The group now believes that the money at two Filipino banks \"almost certainly\" does not exist. The opposition parties are therefore also criticizing the financial supervisory authority Bafin: \"The damage to the image of the German financial center is already immense,\" said the Greens' finance spokeswoman, Lisa Paus. \"It is incomprehensible why the Bafin did not take action much earlier and had long since started a special audit instead of ignoring critical voices.\" Green Group leader Anton Hofreiter said: \"Olaf Scholz and Peter Altmaier as the responsible ministers have a special responsibility here.\" The finance and economics ministers would have to explain their authorities' misconduct. Allegations against Wirecard have been known for a long time: The British \"Financial Times\" had already reported about possible manipulation of balance sheets at Wirecard more than a year ago. Since the Wirecard share price had subsequently dropped sharply on the Frankfurt stock exchange, the Bafin and Munich public prosecutors had started investigations into whether there were illegal maneuvers by speculators. Wirecard boss Markus Braun, who resigned and was briefly arrested last week, had for months rejected the \"FT\" reporting as baseless. As a consequence of the balance sheet scandal, the FDP demands that the Bafin not be entrusted with further tasks. \"Such a mistake must not happen,\" said parliamentary group vice-president Christian Dürr. The Ministry of Finance had to make adjustments. For example, plans should be put on hold to have 98,000 financial intermediaries controlled by the Bafin in the future, rather than previously primarily by chambers of industry and commerce. That could overwhelm the Bonn authorities. In the case of Wirecard, there have been hints for years. \"That must not happen. It damages trust.\" The Federal Ministry of Finance, on the other hand, wants to expand Bafin's competencies as a consequence of the accounting scandal. \"We have to look at the Bafin to see what went wrong,\" said State Secretary Jörg Kukies to the news portal \"The Pioneer\". \"We have to consider whether Bafin's possibilities to intervene are sufficient. Whether companies like Wirecard AG, which effectively provides financial services, cannot be supervised in their entirety as financial service providers.\" Because 1.9 billion euros are missing from the balance sheet, payment processor Wirecard filed for bankruptcy this Thursday. The share of the Dax company crashed again. Bafin boss Felix Hufeld will have to answer questions from members of the Bundestag Finance Committee next week. He has already admitted mistakes made by his authority. \"We have not been effective enough to prevent this from happening,\" said Hufeld. Rapid clarification is now important. What happens to Wirecard is a \"disaster\". The auditing firm EY is also criticized for having tested Wirecard's balance sheets for years without any complaints. EY said that it \"may not be possible to detect this type of conspiratorial fraud\". Wirecard's foreseeable insolvency could be expensive for a number of banks, which have provided the company with up to EUR 1.75 billion via a credit line according to a bond prospectus. According to the prospectus, these include the leading institutes Commerzbank and Landesbank Baden-Württemberg (LBBW), the Dutch ABN Amro and the German subsidiary of the Dutch ING. According to information from the news agencies dpa and Bloomberg, the banks had only granted Wirecard a few days to check the long-term viability of the company before claiming back the outstanding amount. Commerzbank and LBBW did not officially comment on the Wirecard loan on request. The deputy chairman of the left-wing group, Fabio De Masi, spoke of a \"fiasco for the German financial center\". \"If larger sums have to be written off at Commerzbank, Wirecard will also be a burden for taxpayers,\" he said. He called for personnel consequences at Bafin and the abolition of liability limits for auditors.\n",

            " The Stability Council of the Federation and the Länder sees the record new debt of the Federation and the Länder as an \"unprecedented challenge\", but in principle considers the measures taken to date to be correct and indispensable. The measures are \"indispensable to cushion the economic impact of the crisis and support the health system,\" it said in a joint statement after deliberations by the panel. Loan financing for the economic stimulus package launched by the government was \"inevitable in view of the exceptional situation\" and was therefore permissible despite the fact that the EU and the Basic Law exceeded the limits. \"However, the additional debt should be limited to what is necessary,\" the Stabilization Council warned. The federal government's planned new debt alone is EUR 218.5 billion for the current year. \"Determined action is part of responsible financial policy,\" said Federal Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD). \"Doing nothing would exacerbate the crisis and increase costs.\" It is now a matter of creating more growth again. In addition, due to solid financial policy in previous years, the debt level in Germany was still at a lower level than in some other countries before the corona crisis. Scholz said that if the economic forecasts were good, you could be back to the pre-crisis level economically by the end of next year or the beginning of the year after next, and then get away from the suspension of the debt brake. The measures were \"heavily influenced by the preservation of jobs\" and \"a socially balanced distribution was also taken into account,\" said the Rhineland-Palatinate Finance Minister Doris Ahnen (SPD). Schleswig-Holstein's Finance Minister Monika Heinold (Greens) emphasized the importance of investments \"in a sustainable transformation of our economy\". If the younger generations were left with higher debts, it would be all the more important to use the loans to help them get ahead with future tasks such as climate protection and digitalization. The chairman of the independent advisory board of the Stability Council, Thiess Büttner, criticized the lack of medium and long-term forecasts: \"We are worried that what has been presented to us will say nothing about the following years.\" The advisory board expected at least a commitment from the federal and state governments to return to meet the planned debt ceiling after the crisis. Büttner also criticized the planned borrowing at EU level. Scholz said that further developments should be awaited for longer-term forecasts, especially the special tax estimate planned in September. Due to the economic downturn and tax relief, tax revenues are likely to be around EUR 100 billion lower this year than expected last November. For the gross domestic product (GDP), the federal government expects a price-adjusted decline of 6.3 percent.\n",

As of October, workers should only get 60 percent of their normal gross wages instead of the previous 70 percent, President Emmanuel Macron announced. The state then plans to cover 60 percent of the cost of employers, currently 85 percent. 9.40 pm: Just under a week after being admitted to hospital, the President of Honduras, who has Covid-19, was given oxygen. A radiological examination of the head of state and government, Juan Orlando Hernández, had shown an exacerbation of his pneumonia, said the presidential office. There was also suspicion of phlebitis, whereupon he was given a new intravenous access. After an oxygen treatment on Tuesday, his condition had improved significantly - Hernández had neither fever nor breathing difficulties, and the inflammation had decreased. The president of the Central American country is said to continue to be treated at the military hospital in the capital, Tegucigalpa. The 51-year-old was admitted there last Wednesday. 9:24 pm: The Lower Saxony district of Diepholz has quarantined a former barracks site where contract workers live. A spokeswoman for the authority said that 200 people who worked in the slaughterhouse in Wildeshausen in the district of Oldenburg, which was affected by a coronavirus outbreak, were accommodated in the buildings in Wagenfeld. According to the company, 35 workers in the turkey slaughterhouse in Wiesenhof tested positive for the novel corona virus by Wednesday. According to the district spokeswoman, the test results for the workers living in Wagenfeld are still pending. Subcontractors would have rented several buildings on the site, which is more than 40 kilometers south of Wildeshausen. The precautionary quarantine for the barracks area was ordered on Wednesday evening by general decree. A security company should check compliance. \"To be able to classify the infection process correctly, the results of the test must first be waited for. Based on the test results from yesterday, I consider - in this particular case - precautionary quarantine necessary,\" said District Administrator Cord Bockhop (CDU). Then further steps will be decided. According to the authority, 22 people are currently infected with the novel coronavirus in the district of Diepholz. 9:21 pm: The most populous US state, California, has seen a sharp increase in coronavirus cases. Governor Gavin Newsom spoke on Wednesday of 7149 new cases that occurred on Tuesday. In the past 14 days, the number of hospitals with Covid 19 patients has increased by almost 30 percent. \"We are endangering people's lives,\" Newsom warned, calling on the nearly 40 million people to stay at home, keep their distance, and wear masks, if possible. To curb the coronavirus, Newsom ordered a mask last week. According to information from Wednesday, more than 190,000 infections with Sars-CoV-2 have been detected in the west coast state, so far more than 5600 people have died in California. 8:49 pm: According to media reports, the US government plans to provide 13 corona test stations in five US states with federal funding only until the end of June. This is reported, among others, by CNN and CNBC. Trump had previously criticized the increased test capacities. On Tuesday, he downplayed the recent surge in infections in the United States. \"If we test more, we will find more cases,\" he said. \"Testing is a double-edged sword.\" The United States has run more than 25 million tests, more than any other country. Corona's leading US immunologist, Anthony Fauci, had contradicted Trump's view: he said no one from the White House Coronavirus Working Group had ever been instructed to slow tests. \"The opposite is the case. We will test more, not less.\" 8:16 pm: At a doner kebab production in Moers near Duisburg, 17 employees tested positive for the corona virus. The Wesel district reported. The company has a total of 275 employees. The infected are in quarantine, which also applies to 43 other people as a precaution. On Wednesday, all employees of the kebab producer who were present were tested, the circle said. The results were not yet available. The plant was temporarily closed. However, a few employees are likely to continue processing freshly delivered goods in the coming days in order to avoid them spoiling, said the district. The company has an \"excellent hygiene concept\". There are no work contracts or employees who lived in collective accommodation. The 17 infected employees were examined after the NRW Ministry of Health ordered a series test at all slaughterhouses in the state in May. Now the employees who hadn't been able to work because of vacation or short-time work were tested again. 7:25 p.m .: After the summer break, football stadiums in the Netherlands are to reopen to the public. However, only a limited number of viewers will be admitted. Prime Minister Mark Rutte announced on Wednesday. There will be no ghost games, but for many stadiums this means that only one third of the seats in the audience can be filled. However, chants are then prohibited. According to the government's wishes, fans should neither sing nor shout to prevent the spread of the corona virus. Spectators again soon? The Johan Cruyff Arena in Amsterdam at 7.15 p.m .: The United States has a new record of new infections with the corona virus. Around 34,700 new infections were detected on Tuesday - the highest since the end of April and the third highest daily value since the pandemic began, according to data from Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. In comparison: on June 1, the daily value was around 17,400 new infections. The highest number so far (36,400) was recorded on April 24. The US is now carrying out significantly more tests than a few months ago, which President Donald Trump has repeatedly cited as an explanation for the high number of cases. 7:07 p.m .: According to estimates by the World Health Organization (WHO), the number of reported corona infections worldwide could rise to ten million next week. \"We have to do everything we can to prevent the spread of the virus and further deaths,\" said WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus in Geneva on Wednesday. To date, 9.1 million corona cases have been reported. Around 470,000 people died from or with Covid-19. 18:57: The accommodation ban announced by Bavaria for people from Corona risk areas comes into force on Thursday (June 25). This emerges from the now completed ordinance of the state health ministry. Accordingly, accommodation companies in Bavaria are not allowed to accept guests who \"arrive or have their residence from a district or an independent city in another federal state\", in which or in which the number of new corona infections within seven days for more than 50 per 100,000 inhabitants lay. This does not apply to people who have a negative corona test and who have a medical certificate. Also excluded from the prohibition are guests who \"must arrive for work or medically induced reasons and cannot be delayed\" or who can prove \"another valid reason for travel\". 6.44 p.m .: The Paris Louvre made a loss of 40 million euros in the corona crisis. This was announced by museum director Jean-Luc Martinez after the museum had been closed for more than three months. The Louvre is scheduled to reopen on July 6th. Tickets must be reserved in advance on the Internet, and a mask requirement and distance rules are planned. In summer, the museum management only expects a fraction of the people who normally come. \"75 percent of our visitors come from abroad,\" emphasized Martinez. Asians and US tourists in particular are currently staying away from the French capital. There had been a particularly large number of coronavirus cases in the Paris area. View of the Louvre at 6:20 p.m .: The US states of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut impose a two-week quarantine for all those arriving from states with a higher infection rate. The rule will come into force on Wednesday at midnight local time, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said at a short-term press conference. The list of countries of origin of travelers who are quarantined is constantly updated depending on the level of infection. Currently Florida and Arizona are among them. Cuomo had previously announced plans to consider quarantine. With just under 800 deaths and tens of thousands of new infections per day, New York was the global epicenter of the pandemic a few months ago. 5.50 p.m .: Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer (CSU) has criticized the Austrian government's decision to issue a partial travel warning for North Rhine-Westphalia because of the Corona outbreak. At a meeting in Berlin, Seehofer asked his Austrian colleague Karl Nehammer to reconsider the decision. He suggested that such travel warnings should not be issued across the board for entire federal states, but should be restricted to \"regional hotspots\". The Austrian government had justified the travel warning with the coronavirus outbreak at the Tönnies slaughterhouse. According to the government in Vienna, the warning means that travel to NRW is warned and Austrians who are already there should contact their embassy. In addition, there will initially be no direct flights between Austria and North Rhine-Westphalia. 17:35: Several employees have also been infected with the corona virus in a slaughterhouse in the municipality of Essen in the district of Cloppenburg (Lower Saxony). According to the NDR, they are employees of the Danish Crown company. Four of them were therefore tested positive. All 350 colleagues would now also be tested. A total of 1,500 people work at Danish Crown in Essen. On Tuesday, 23 cases in a turkey slaughterhouse in Wildeshausen (district of Oldenburg) were reported in Lower Saxony. All around 1100 employees are to be tested there. The results should be available on Friday. 17.12 p.m .: According to a media report, the Berlin Charité and Deutsche Bahn are starting a study lasting several months on the risks of corona infection in long-distance rail transport. As of the end of this month, at least 400 train attendants, 150 train drivers and 150 maintenance workers at the locations in Berlin, Frankfurt am Main, Hamburg and Munich should be examined for acute corona infections and immunity, the \"Wirtschaftswoche\" reported in advance on Wednesday, citing a paper from the web. Accordingly, the railways and researchers want to compare infections and immunities in the three occupational groups. For example, knowledge should be gained as to whether the train attendants are at higher risk of infection than other professional groups on the train. 4:59 p.m .: Amnesty International has warned of disproportionate coercive measures against minorities in the coronavirus pandemic in Europe. According to a report released on Wednesday, human rights defenders in 12 European countries have experienced excessive violence, discriminatory controls, quarantine measures and fines against minorities. The report refers to incidents in the UK, France, Spain, Italy and Belgium and several countries in Southeast Europe, among others. Germany was not included in the analysis. The investigation is based on reports in the media and from local human rights organizations from March to June. According to this, Roma, other minorities and refugees in particular were exposed to above-average measures in the coronavirus pandemic. Amnesty criticized the forced quarantine for several Roma settlements in Bulgaria and Slovakia. In the French department of Seine-Saint-Denis north of Paris, which is populated by many immigrants, the fines were three times as high as in other parts of France, the report said. In Belgium, human rights defenders reported more than a hundred allegations of police abuse between mid-March and late May. 4:48 pm: Sweden's state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell regrets part of his strategy in dealing with the corona virus. Protection against infection of the elderly in Swedish senior homes has failed and the death rate is \"terrible,\" said Tegnell in Wednesday's popular \"Sommar\" program on Swedish radio. \"We probably thought that our age-segregated society would allow us to avoid a situation like in Italy, where different generations live together much more often, but that turned out to be wrong.\" There is growing criticism of Sweden's relaxed corona strategy, for which Tegnell was responsible. Because the infection and death rate per inhabitant is very high compared to the rest of Scandinavia and also to Germany. According to the state health authority, around 62,300 people have so far been tested positive for the virus in the country with just over ten million inhabitants. More than 5200 people have died from a corona infection. 16:32: With the number of cases falling for weeks, Belgium continues to relax the corona restrictions. From July, Belgians can meet up to 15 people a week, as Prime Minister Sophie Wilmès said on Wednesday after a meeting of the National Security Council. So far, only ten people were allowed. Leisure centers such as swimming pools, theaters and wellness centers are also allowed to reopen and receive up to 50 visitors. Distance and hygiene rules must be observed, as reported by the Belgian media. Events with up to 200 people inside and up to 400 people in the fresh air can also take place again from next Wednesday under certain conditions. The same value applies to demonstrations. From August, 400 or 800 people are to be allowed. 16:24: The corona pandemic has also led to the cancellation of the traditional New York marathon. The \"incredibly disappointed\" organizers announced their decision on Wednesday. The run planned for November 1 with a destination in Manhattan, like the events in Berlin, Tokyo, Chicago, Boston and London, is part of the elite series \"World Marathon Majors\". 16:21: According to a corona mass test among employees of a turkey slaughterhouse of the Wiesenhof group in Lower Saxony, the number of infected has increased to 35. According to the Wiesenhof mother PHW, 341 people were tested in the company in Wildeshausen by Wednesday afternoon. Among the 35 infected, there are four permanent employees and 31 workers with a contract. In consultation with the authorities, the employees and contact persons were identified immediately and were in quarantine. All employees of the company are said to have been tested by Friday afternoon. 4:07 pm: Italy is taking further steps to relax precautionary measures in sport. As of Thursday, the practice of contact sports is again permitted, and training can also be carried out and played in halls without safety gaps. \"Sports centers are allowed to open all over the country. This will allow thousands of people to resume their activities,\" announced Minister of Sports Vincenzo Spadafora. 15:59: Corona tests in the population in Gütersloh provide hope for district administrator Sven-Georg Adenauer. The first results of 600 current smears were available. 230 results were found, 229 of them were negative, and one result is still open. \"It's a very small glimmer of hope,\" says Adenauer. The virus had broken out in a slaughterhouse. Cold, dry and unprepared air could have played a role here, explains hygiene professor Martin Exner. High-performance filtration could help. This also applies to other companies in the industry. 15:34: In view of the massive outbreaks of the corona virus at a meat factory in North Rhine-Westphalia, the Federal Government has underlined that the federal states are still responsible for crisis management in the pandemic. It is up to the local states to decide whether the requirements need to be tightened or not, said deputy government spokeswoman Ulrike Demmer in Berlin on Wednesday. The responsibilities remained the same now. After many countries had deviated from a common line in the relaxation of the corona restrictions, the federal government and the states agreed at the beginning of May that the states would assume extensive responsibility for the relaxation. In return, they should guarantee any tightening that may be necessary. 3.13 p.m .: After the massive corona outbreak in a Tönnies meat business, public life in two districts of North Rhine-Westphalia is again restricted. At midnight, strict conditions again came into force in the Gütersloh district and in the neighboring district of Warendorf. Around 640,000 inhabitants are affected. The Tönnies plant in Rheda-Wiedenbrück in the Gütersloh district is the starting point for the outbreak, and many Tönnies employees also live in the Warendorf area. In the public space, only two people or people from a family or household group can now meet, as the state government announced on Tuesday. In addition, a number of leisure activities should be avoided. For example, museums, cinemas, gyms, indoor swimming pools and bars have to be temporarily closed. The new restrictions will initially apply for one week through June 30. Representatives of both circles spoke of a \"lockdown light\" because shops and restaurants can remain open. He called the measures \"Lockdown soft or Lockdown light\", said District Administrator Sven-Georg Adenauer (CDU). \"If you compare it to what we had in March, it is something that you can come to terms with. Not so hard and only limited to one week.\" 3:09 p.m .: Every seventh person in Germany now uses the Corona warning app to track contacts with Covid-19 infected people. The Robert Koch Institute reports that it has been downloaded 12.6 million times. This corresponds to a share of around 15 percent of the population. Researchers at Oxford University are of the opinion that the app will work as soon as 15 percent participate. At this point you will find external content from Twitter that complements the article.

            " 3:02 p.m .: Brazil registered 1374 corona deaths within 24 hours. This was announced by the Ministry of Health in Brasília. According to the \"G1\" portal, after 1470 deaths on June 4, it is the second highest number recorded for a 24-hour period since the pandemic began. The number of corona deaths in Brazil rose to 52,645. 39,436 were newly infected. In total, according to official data, more than a million people in the largest and most populous country in Latin America have been infected with the corona virus. Only the United States has seen more infections and deaths so far. The actual numbers in Brazil are likely to be much higher, also because the country tests very little. 14:58: According to the Ministry of Health, almost 10,000 people have died in connection with the coronavirus in Iran. In the past 24 hours alone, 133 corona patients have been killed, Ministry spokeswoman Sima Lari said on Wednesday on state television. During the same period, there were more than 2500 new infections. The number of fatalities is currently at 9996 and that of the infected at 212.501, said the spokeswoman. After a temporary drop in infections at the end of May, Iran eased the anti-corona measures. Since then, work has been permitted in almost all industries. According to experts, this is the main reason for the further increase in the number of cases. According to the Ministry of Health, the easing also meant that only ten percent of the population took hygiene regulations seriously. The Ministry is now planning to introduce a mask requirement. Despite criticism of his easing policy, President Hassan Ruhani wants to remain true to his line. He was of the opinion that the Corona crisis would continue for longer and that a longer-term restriction of economic activities would not be feasible. According to Ruhani, the Iranians should learn to live with the virus. His health minister Saeid Namaki also believes that there will be no end to the Corona crisis in 2022. 2:51 p.m .: In the dispute over the further implementation of corona tests, the doctors want to act against a significantly falling remuneration for the laboratories. A spokesman for the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians (KBV) had been filed with the Berlin-Brandenburg State Social Court against the decision of the responsible body in the health system. It also represents laboratory doctors. The aim is therefore to have a suspensive effect, i.e. that the reduction will not come as early as July 1. For tests initiated by medical practitioners, laboratories are to receive 39.40 euros instead of the previous 59 euros from July 1. The KBV had already protested the decision, which was against their votes. She complains that the new price was set without an appropriate calculation basis. Statutory health insurers, on the other hand, had spoken of an \"appropriate price\" that reflected the development of individual tests into mass tests. 2:44 pm: After the corona fiasco during the Adriatic tour of the Serbian tennis star Novak Djokovic, the publics of Serbia and Croatia are under the spell of a heated debate about responsibility. In the meantime, Djokovic, his wife Jelena, the Bulgarian Grigor Dimitrov, the Croatian Borna Coric and the Serbian Viktor Troicki have tested positive for the corona virus. Djokovic had organized the Adriatic tour, which had meanwhile been broken off, and disregarded the corona-related hygiene rules at competitions in Belgrade and Zadar in Croatia. However, the Belgrade press took the world number one under protection on Wednesday and launched a counterattack on its critics. Djokovic is considered a national idol in his homeland. In Croatia, the corona fiasco put the conservative Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic under pressure. The conservative politician had sat in crowds at the competition in Zadar and talked to Djokovic in passing. Pictures show how he puts his hand on the jersey of the Serbian world star. There was no more contact, said Plenkovic. A subsequent Covid 19 test was negative. The opposition nevertheless demands that he go to home quarantine. 2:17 p.m .: The Swiss government will assume the costs of corona tests from Thursday. \"The most important element in disrupting the infection chain is rigorous contact tracing with extensive testing for Sars Coronavirus-2,\" the government said after its regular meeting. At the moment there is a risk that people will not be tested if they have to bear the cost of the test themselves. In future, the federal government will pay for both infection tests and serological tests for the detection of antibodies. The mobile phone app for tracking infected people can also be downloaded from Thursday. A pilot trial with the SwissCovid app has been running for around a month. 13:59: All employees of a turkey slaughterhouse belonging to the Wiesenhof Group in Wildeshausen, Lower Saxony, have been tested for the corona virus since Wednesday. More than 1100 people are affected. Corona infections had already been identified in 23 employees on Tuesday. The samples were taken from a private laboratory, but \"carried out under the close supervision of the health authority,\" said a spokesman for the district of Oldenburg. \"It has to go very quickly now.\" As the day progresses, test results from Tuesday are also expected. It is about 150 direct contacts of the infected employees identified at the beginning of the week. A slaughterhouse that is majority owned by the PHW group (Wiesenhof) is affected. The company had declared that all employees would be tested again in the coming days - at the beginning of June there had already been a first run. The district quarantined the direct contacts and work colleagues. 13:37: North Rhine-Westphalia wants clarity on the weekend whether the Corona virus in the districts of Warendorf and Gütersloh from the staff of the Tönnies slaughterhouse has affected the rest of the population. \"With the highest possible number of tests, we might want to know on Sunday whether the virus has skipped,\" said health minister Karl-Josef Laumann in the Düsseldorf state parliament. \"This will result in other measures.\" Laumann criticizes working conditions in the meat industry: \"This system has nothing to do with a humane working environment.\" The companies Tönnies and Westfleisch said a few weeks ago that the system would collapse without a contract worker. Now both said that it could also work without such workers: \"Well, I can fool myself.\" 1:16 pm: The corona pandemic has an impact on some \"crime scene\" filming because the originally planned scripts cannot be implemented. The NDR changes the \"Tatort\" production with Maria Furtwängler and Florence Kasumba - the Göttingen team of investigators: \"The shooting starts with a completely rewritten template,\" says the broadcaster on request. The \"Tatort\" in Saarbrücken is about a school lesson. \"For example, we are shooting a school lesson in a class with questioning by the commissioners. At the moment we are considering moving the scene outside, but this has not yet been finally decided,\" said Saarländische Rundfunk (SR). The Südwestdeutscher Rundfunk (SWR) said that the remaining scenes for the Odenthal \"crime scene\" were modified due to hygiene requirements. \"This simplifies scenes, changes the course of action, reduces extras, searches for new locations so that the health of everyone involved in the shoot can be guaranteed.\" Special rules apply to the set because of the corona restrictions. Actors Axel Prahl and Jan-Josef Liefers, for example, were seen wearing masks on the set during the current shooting of the \"Münster\" crime scene. Prahl told the German Press Agency: \"It is a great pleasure for me that it is finally starting again. There are, of course, many things that have to be taken into account. The shooting is a little different,\" he said with regard to the restrictions due to Corona . 01:01 p.m .: With the reopening of the gastronomy on July 4th, the British will also have to save their names in pubs and restaurants before they can drink a beer there. The companies have to keep the data for 21 days in order to track contacts in the event of an infection, as the government reports. The measure is intended to help curb local virus outbreaks and avoid a second wave of infections. This rule also applies to hairdressing salons, which is similar in Germany. The distance rule has been reduced from two to one meter. This allows more bars and restaurants to open again. A drink at the counter remains prohibited, as do live performances by musicians, actors and comedians. 12.54 p.m .: More than three months after its temporary closure as a result of the corona pandemic, the Louvre Abu Dhabi was reopened to visitors on Wednesday. The move came in the wake of easing exit restrictions that the United Arab Emirates (UAE) wants to use to prevent the spread of corona. Visitors must book tickets in advance and wear face masks and gloves, as the Louvre Abu Dhabi said on its website. Accordingly, you may not stay in the museum for more than three hours. Abu Dhabi's information office said museums are only likely to drop 40 percent of their capacity. The Louvre Abu Dhabi and other cultural institutions in the UAE have been closed since mid-March. 12.44 p.m .: Kyrgyz President Sooronbaj Scheenbekow, after landing in Moscow, temporarily canceled his participation in the military parade because of two corona cases in his delegation. Anything else would have been an irresponsible step towards other parade participants, the Presidential Office in the capital, Bishkek, announced on Wednesday. The 61-year-old Scheenbekow himself was not ill. He had already arrived in the Russian capital on Tuesday. Before the arms show on the 75th anniversary of the Soviet Union's victory over Hitler's Germany, the delegation had to undergo corona tests again. That was what the regulations regarding the corona pandemic provided for protection against mass infection. 12.19 p.m .: According to SPIEGEL information, the EU is developing criteria for a list of countries whose citizens will soon be allowed to enter again. The US could be excluded from this because of the rampant corona infections. Read more here. 12.10 p.m .: Worries about a new wave of corona infections spread again on Wednesday. Despite surprisingly good sentiment data from German companies in June, the Dax plummeted and lost its previous day's profits again. Towards noon, the leading German index fell 2.32 percent to 12,233.69 points. On Tuesday, he had temporarily climbed above the 12,600 point mark again. Investors also became cautious as Wall Street is also expected to experience losses at the start of trading. The MDax of medium-sized market stocks lost 1.61 percent to 25,748.33 points. The leading Eurozone index, EuroStoxx 50, lost 2.1 percent. 11:54 am: Just over a week after the introduction of the German Corona warning app, the program alerted users who were in the vicinity of infected people for the first time. Two dozen users have registered a Covid-19 infection. Read more here. 11.41 a.m .: Thailand wants to allow first entries from abroad again from next week after a week-long ban. Among other things, it concerns business travelers and investors with work permits who have registered for a 14-day quarantine, says a government official. Foreigners who want to come to Thailand for medical treatment are also likely to come. The central bank assumes that due to the corona consequences, only about eight million people will come to Thailand from abroad this year. In 2019 there were almost 40 million. 11:36: The coronavirus pandemic threatens the health care of millions of women and children in poor countries, according to the World Bank. Fear of contagion and blocking measures to curb the virus have often disrupted the already fragile health care system in these countries, the World Bank health experts said, referring to a survey in 36 countries. On the one hand, there is a shortage or lack of workers in the medical field because of this, on the other hand, many people do without examinations. Impairments range from the care of newborns and mothers and pregnant women to vaccinations and contraception. They are very concerned about the number of children who lack vaccinations, women who give birth without medical help, and the interrupted supply of life-saving medicines such as antibiotics. This is particularly the case in sub-Saharan Africa. 11.30 a.m .: Despite the corona crisis, prices for residential real estate are likely to increase further, according to a study by the Federal Association of German People's and Raiffeisen Banks (BVR). According to this, the prices for owner-occupied residential property will increase by 4.8 percent nationwide in 2020, which is only slightly less than in 2019 at 5.7 percent. \"The influx of many people to the swarm cities will continue, and the continuing favorable financing conditions should prevent a price slump,\" explains BVR board member Andreas Martin. The virus pandemic is adversely affecting the labor market and tending to lower disposable income for consumers. But as the economy stabilizes, \"the bottom line is that the effects of the corona crisis on residential property prices will remain manageable\". 11:22: In the United States, the number of new infections with the coronavirus is increasing in numerous US states. The leading US immunologist Anthony Fauci was concerned about the significantly increasing number of cases. At a hearing in the House of Representatives, he spoke of a \"worrying increase in infections\" in Florida, Texas, Arizona and other states. 10.55 Uhr: \"In Zusammenhang mit der neuerlichen Ausbreitung des Coronavirus gilt für Nordrhein-Westfalen eine partielle Reisewarnung (Sicherheitsstufe 5) - vor Reisen nach Nordrhein-Westfalen wird gewarnt\", hieß es am Mittwoch auf der Webseite des österreichischen Außenministeriums. \"Vor allem unser Nachbarland Deutschland mit der Region Nordrhein-Westfalen hat gezeigt, wie schnell es zu einer weiteren dramatischen Situation kommen kann\", sagt Bundeskanzler Sebastian Kurz nach einer Kabinettssitzung der Regierung. Der konservative Politiker ergänzt, er hoffe, dass es zu keiner Ausbreitung auf ganz Deutschland komme. For the rest of Germany, the Ministry sees a lower security risk (level 4) with the proviso that \"trips to the country that are not absolutely necessary are discouraged.\" There are 6 levels in total. The highest applies if the travel warning affects an entire country. Auf der gleichen \"partiellen\" Stufe wie NRW stehen in Österreich aktuell unter anderem die chinesische Provinz Hubei und die italienische Lombardei.

            " 10.42 Uhr: Mehrere Kommunen an der niedersächsischen Nordseeküste prüfen zeitlich begrenzte Aufenthaltsverbote für Urlauber aus den nordrhein-westfälischen Kreisen Gütersloh und Warendorf. \"We are now in the consultation phase with colleagues, from Leer to Wesermarsch,\" said District Administrator of Friesland, Sven Ambrosy, on Wednesday. Man müsse kurz vor dem Beginn der Sommerferien dringend eine Lösung dafür finden, wie sich Infektionsrisiken senken ließen, wenn Menschen aus Gebieten mit lokalen Corona-Shutdowns weiterhin reisen dürften. Im Laufe des Tages soll es Beratungen mit Rechtsexperten der Kommunen über eine für die Dauer der Beschränkungen in den Herkunftskreisen greifende touristische Aufenthaltsperre geben. \"Wir neigen dazu, eine Allgemeinverfügung zu machen\", erklärte Ambrosy, der auch Vorsitzender des Tourismusverbands Niedersachsen ist. \"Aber die müsste auch juristisch sicher sein.\" Man brauche Klarheit: Entweder müssten sich die Länder wie im Fall Mecklenburg-Vorpommerns und Bayerns deutlich dazu verhalten, oder einzelne Kommunen müssten die Möglichkeit zum zeitweisen Ausschluss von Feriengästen haben. Der Landrat kritisierte das Land NRW: Es sei unverständlich, örtlich die Beschränkungen zu verschärfen, aber Bewohner weiter reisen zu lassen. Niedersachsen will nach aktuellem Stand keine Menschen aus dem Nachbarbundesland zurückweisen. 10.30 Uhr: Der nordrhein-westfälische Ministerpräsident Armin Laschet hat die anderen Bundesländer aufgerufen, negativ auf das Corona-Virus getestete Urlauber aus den Kreisen Gütersloh und Warendorf willkommen zu heißen. Für beide Kreise hatte die Landesregierung erneut deutliche Einschränkungen des öffentlichen Lebens verhängt, um ein Übergreifen des Corona-Virus aus einem Tönnies-Schlachthof auf die übrige Bevölkerung zu verhindern. Bayern hatte ein Beherbergungsverbot für Gäste aus Landkreisen mit hohen Infektionszahlen angekündigt, Menschen mit negativen Tests aber ausgenommen. Er habe in dieser Sache mit dem bayerischen Ministerpräsidenten Markus Söder telefoniert, der klar gemacht habe, dass Menschen aus Gütersloh willkommen seien, sagt Laschet im Landtag. Er erwarte dies auch von anderen Bundesländern. Menschen aus Gütersloh dürften nicht stigmatisiert werden. 10.21 Uhr: Die Zahl der amtlich bestätigten Coronavirus-Infizierten in Russland steigt über die Marke von 600.000. Zuletzt seien 7176 neue Fälle hinzugekommen, die Gesamtzahl klettere damit auf 606.881, teilen die Behörden mit. Dies ist die dritthöchste Zahl weltweit. Die Zahl der Todesfälle in Russland sei binnen 24 Stunden um 154 auf 8513 gestiegen. 10.19 Uhr: Nach den jüngsten Virusausbrüchen in der Fleischindustrie will Bundeslandwirtschaftsministerin Julia Klöckner am Freitag mit Vertretern der Branche über eine \"Neujustierung der Nutztierhaltung\" sprechen. Gemeinsam mit ihren Amtskolleginnen aus Nordrhein-Westfalen und Niedersachsen, Ursula Heinen-Esser und Barbara Otte-Kinast, lade Klöckner dazu Schlachtereien, Tierhalter, Ernährungswirtschaft, Verbraucher, Lebensmittelhandel, Kartellamt, Tierschützer und Veterinäre ein, heißt es in einer Pressemitteilung ihres Ministeriums. Fleisch und Wurst seien in Deutschland oft zu billig. Deshalb seien faire Löhne und Arbeitsbedingungen, hohe Tierwohlstandards und ein auskömmliches Einkommen von Tierhaltern schwer zu erreichen. \"Hier muss sich etwas ändern.\" 10.06 Uhr: Gesundheitsexperten warnen eindringlich vor einer zweiten Corona-Infektionswelle in Großbritannien. There is a \"real risk,\" they wrote in a letter published on Wednesday by the British Medical Journal. Sie kritisierten damit die bisher umfangreichste Lockerung der Pandemiemaßnahmen in England. Premier Boris Johnson hatte sie am Dienstag bekannt gegeben. Es müsse nun schnell gehandelt werden, um noch mehr Todesopfer und Verluste für die Wirtschaft zu verhindern, fordern die Experten in einem offenen Brief an die Parteispitzen. Den Appell unterschrieben unter anderem die Präsidenten medizinischer Fachgesellschaften. Pubs, Restaurants, Hotels, Museen, Galerien, Kinos, Bibliotheken, Friseursalons und Kirchen dürfen unter bestimmten Auflagen ab 4. Juli wieder in England öffnen. At the same time, Johnson had announced that the distance rule would be reduced from two meters to one meter. Die neuen Maßnahmen gelten nur für England. Jeder Landesteil in Großbritannien bestimmt über seine eigenen Maßnahmen. Auch Regierungsberater aus dem Medizinbereich hatten am Dienstag die Lockerungen als \"nicht risikofrei\" bezeichnet. Großbritannien ist das am schwersten von der Coronakrise betroffene Land in Europa: Nach offiziellen Statistiken starben 43.000 positiv auf das Virus getestete Menschen. Experten gehen von einer hohen Dunkelziffer aus. 10.00 Uhr: Der Serbe Nikola Jokic von den Denver Nuggets, einer der besten Center der Liga, wurde im Zuge der Vorbereitung auf die restliche Saison positiv auf Covid-19 getestet. Das berichtet die \"Denver Post\". Jokic hatte vor einer Woche zusammen mit seinem ebenfalls positiv getesteten Landsmann Novak Djokovic ein Basketballmatch besucht. 9.52 Uhr: Weltweit sind bereits mehr als 475.000 Menschen mit oder an einer Coronavirus-Infektion gestorben. Dies ergab am Mittwoch eine Zählung der Nachrichtenagentur AFP, die auf Behördenangaben beruht. Damit verdoppelte sich die Zahl der Corona-Toten in weniger als zwei Monaten auf nun 477.117. Rund um den Globus wurden 9.263.743 Infektionen mit dem Coronavirus registriert. Europa bleibt mit 193.800 Toten und 2.557.761 Infektionsfällen die am stärksten von der Pandemie betroffene Region. Das Virus breitet sich jedoch schnell in Lateinamerika aus, wo bislang 100.378 Menschen starben. Die Zahl der offiziell Infizierten beläuft sich dort auf 2.163.835. Das am stärksten betroffene Land weltweit sind die USA, gefolgt von Brasilien und Russland. 9.32 Uhr: Im Zuge der Coronakrise ist die Rohstahlproduktion in Deutschland auch im Mai eingebrochen, wie die Wirtschaftsvereinigung Stahl mitteilt. Im Vergleich zum Vorjahresmonat sinkt die Stahlerzeugung um 27 Prozent, nachdem sie im April bereits um 24 Prozent nachgelassen hatte. Der Branchenverband befürchtet, dass die Absatzflaute auch über das Jahresende hinaus anhält. Die gesamte Produktionsmenge könnte noch unter den Tiefstand der Finanzkrise 2009 rutschen, als die deutschen Hütten 32,7 Millionen Tonnen Stahl gekocht hatten. Im vergangenen Jahr waren es 39,7 Millionen Tonnen. 9.14 Uhr: Bundesgesundheitsminister Jens Spahn (CDU) hat vor der bundesweiten Gefahr durch regionale Corona-Hotspots gewarnt. \"Wenn man es diesem Virus zu leicht macht, dann breitet es sich auch ganz schnell wieder aus\", sagte er am Mittwoch im ARD-\"Morgenmagazin\". He understood the disappointment in the Gütersloh and Warendorf districts of North Rhine-Westphalia, for which corona loosening was largely withdrawn after the massive outbreak at the Tönnies meat group. Es sei jetzt wichtig, auch deutlich zu machen, dass dies zum Schutz sowohl für die Bürger vor Ort wie auch aller Menschen im Bundesgebiet erforderlich sei, mahnte Spahn. Nach dem Ausbruch in Heinsberg etwa habe man gesehen, \"wie schnell aus lokalem Geschehen dann auch bundesweites werden kann\". Bei Tönnies in Rheda-Wiedenbrück im Kreis Gütersloh hatten die Behörden in der vergangenen Woche einen massiven Corona-Ausbruch registriert. Dort wurden mehr als 1550 der etwa 7000 Beschäftigten positiv auf das Coronavirus getestet. In den Kreisen Gütersloh und Warendorf gelten nun unter anderem wieder strenge Kontaktbeschränkungen. Freizeitaktivitäten in geschlossenen Räumen sind nicht mehr gestattet, Ausstellungen und Museen müssen wieder schließen, ebenso Bars, Fitnessstudios und Saunen. Geschäfte sowie Restaurants und Speisegaststätten können dagegen geöffnet bleiben, letztere aber nur noch für Menschen aus einem Hausstand. 9.05 Uhr: Das Robert-Koch-Institut (RKI) in Berlin hat die Zahl der in Deutschland mit dem Coronavirus infizierten Menschen am Mittwoch mit 191.449 angegeben - ein Plus von 587 seit dem Vortag. Die in der US-Stadt Baltimore ansässige Johns-Hopkins-Universität (JHU) meldete 192.480 Infizierte. Das RKI, das nur die elektronisch übermittelten Zahlen aus den Bundesländern berücksichtigt und seine Aufstellung einmal täglich aktualisiert, registrierte 8914 Todesfälle und damit 19 mehr als am Vortag. Die JHU zählte ebenfalls 8914 Tote. Die Zahl der Genesenen betrug laut RKI etwa 176.300. 3.30 Uhr: Der Gouverneur des US-Bundesstaates Washington hat das Tragen von Gesichtsmasken in der Öffentlichkeit angeordnet. \"Es geht darum, Leben zu retten. Es geht darum, unsere Unternehmen wieder zu öffnen. Und es geht darum, Respekt und Fürsorge füreinander zu zeigen\", sagt Gouverneur Jay Inslee, der Anfang des Jahres die Nominierung der Demokraten für das Präsidentenamt anstrebte. Washington verzeichnete in der vergangenen Woche einen Anstieg der Fallzahlen um 35 Prozent.\n",

            " In Mexico, after a 7.5 magnitude earthquake, the death toll has risen to ten. Another 23 people were injured, according to Mexican civil defense chief David León, Foro TV. According to him, 46 million people in the country could feel the tremor. The seismological service reported more than 1,700 aftershocks with a magnitude of up to 5.5 within 24 hours. The center of the earthquake on Tuesday was off the Pacific coast of the southern state of Oaxaca, 23 kilometers south of the village of Crucecita at a depth of five kilometers. The quake was also clearly felt in several other states - including in the capital Mexico City, about 700 kilometers away. According to the governor of Oaxaca, Alejandro Murat, the quake caused damage in 85 localities in his state alone. As a result, more than 2,000 homes and 59 schools were damaged. A few dozen people were placed in emergency shelters. Murat said it was still looking for possible further victims under rubble. All ten confirmed deaths to date have been registered in Oaxaca. According to the civil protection agency, there were cracks and other damage to more than 30 buildings in Mexico City. An already empty house was cordoned off due to the risk of collapse. As a precautionary measure, numerous buildings have been cleared, including hospitals. Videos of fluctuating high-rise buildings in the capital spread on social media. The entire west coast of the American double continent lies on the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire, which is known for its seismic activity. In Mexico, violent quakes occur again and again. A 7.1 magnitude quake killed two and a half years, 369 people, 228 of them in Mexico City - at that time the epicenter was much closer to the capital. The disaster struck exactly 32 years after the 8.1 magnitude earthquake that killed at least 10,000 people in Mexico City in 1985.\n",

            " The brutal death of African American George Floyd has sparked protests against racism worldwide - and sparked a new debate about colonial history. The focus is always on historical monuments from this period. After a demonstration against a statue, violent unrest occurred in Hoorn, North Holland. Around 200 mostly young people rioted late Friday evening and sought confrontation with the police, Jan Nieuwenburg's mayor of the city in the north of Amsterdam said on the radio. \"You deliberately misused the demonstration.\" Initially, according to the police, several hundred people had protested peacefully against the controversial monument to the representative of the Dutch colonial empire in the 17th century, Jan Pieterszoon Coen. About 20 people had demonstrated for the still image at the same time. According to the mayor, the riots are a reason to remove the monument. \"We can have a good and bad discussion. But thinking about history doesn't stop there.\" The city had already mentioned the merits, but also the atrocities of Coen on a sign on the monument in 2011. Jan Pieterszoon Coen (1587-1629), born in Hoorn, was governor general of the East Indies colony. He founded today's Jakarta. Coen is also responsible for a massacre on the spice island of Banda, which earned him the nickname \"Butcher of Banda\". In other countries, colonial monuments are currently the subject of protests again. In Bristol, England, demonstrators threw a statue of a slave trader into the harbor basin a good two weeks ago. In London, right-wing extremists recently took to the streets to defend the monuments. And in Richmond, United States, it was recently decided to remove a controversial statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee. In France, President Emmanuel Macron doesn't want to know about it. \"The Republic will not erase any trace or name of its history. The Republic will not mine statues,\" he said in a recent television speech.\n",

            " In the United States, the number of new infections with the corona virus is increasing in numerous US states. The leading US immunologist Anthony Fauci was concerned about the significantly increasing number of cases. At a hearing in the House of Representatives, he spoke of a \"worrying increase in infections\" in Florida, Texas, Arizona and other states. In Texas, the number of new infections has peaked at over 5,000 since the pandemic began. The hospitalization rate is also at an all-time high. Given the sharp rise, Governor Greg Abbott has called on the state's citizens to stay at home. \"Because the virus is spreading so quickly right now, there is no reason for you to leave your home unless it is required. The safest place for you is your home,\" Abbott told local television broadcaster KBTX. Texas was one of the first states to announce easing of protection measures in April. Abbott warned on Tuesday of compliance with the guidelines, for example for bars, and threatened consequences for operators who disregarded them. He urged the citizens to protect themselves from the corona virus by wearing masks, washing hands and social distance. The Washington state governor has ordered the wearing of face masks in public. \"It's about saving lives. It's about reopening our companies. It's about showing respect and care for one another,\" said Governor Jay Inslee, who sought to nominate Democrats for the presidency earlier this year. Washington saw a 35 percent increase in case numbers last week. According to the Washington Post, the number of new infections nationwide on Tuesday was 33,730 - the highest since April 25. The number of Covid-19 fatalities also rose to more than 800 that day. Around half of the US states have seen an increase in cases, including Arkansas, California, North and South Carolina, and Tennessee. US President Trump attributes the recent rise to increased corona testing in the population. \"If we test more, we will find more cases,\" he said. \"Testing is a double-edged sword.\" The United States has conducted 27.5 million tests, more than any other country. Trump said at a rally on Saturday that he asked \"his people\" to slow down the tests. The White House then said that the president had \"obviously kidding\". Immunologist Fauci said Tuesday that no one in the White House coronavirus group had ever been instructed to slow tests. \"The opposite is the case. We will test more, not less.\" The United States is the country with the most identified coronavirus infections worldwide. More than 2.3 million cases have been recorded since the pandemic started. More than 120,000 people died after being infected with the Sars-CoV-2 pathogen. Nevertheless, the US president continues to refer to the infection as \"Kung Flu\" and thus discredits China. Speaking to fans in Phoenix, Arizona, he said he knew \"19 or 20 names\" for the virus, which was first discovered in China and then spread throughout the world. \"There has never been anything with so many names for,\" said Trump. When the audience in Phoenix heard \"Kung Flu\" calls, the president said, \"Kung Flu, yes, Kung Flu.\" Then he got thunderous applause. At the appearance, Trump's supporters sat close together and mostly without protective masks in the auditorium. Trump first said on Saturday at an election rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, that he knew several names for the \"Chinese virus\", including \"Kung Flu\". He then faced racism allegations that the White House disagreed with. Spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany said before Trump's appearance in Arizona that Trump only wanted to draw attention to the origin of the virus. Trump is campaigning for a quick reopening of the economy and wants - probably also with a view to the election in November - a return to normality as quickly as possible. According to him, the corona virus is gradually disappearing from the United States.\n",

            " The International Monetary Fund (IMF) publishes a global economic forecast, the World Economic Outlook, twice a year. The previous edition in April was dedicated to the fight against the corona pandemic, its title was: \"The big lockdown\". The economic consequences of this struggle are now becoming clearer, which is why the IMF is now publishing an update. Her title sounds dramatic: \"A crisis like no other, an uncertain recovery\". As was the case in Germany recently, the economists in Washington are now significantly lowering their forecasts. According to this, the global economy is likely to collapse by 4.9 percent this year. In April the IMF had assumed a minus of three percent - and had already rated this development as \"much worse\" than the financial crisis from 2007. For the first time, the fund now predicts a shrinking economic performance in all regions of the world. However, the effects differ considerably depending on the country. According to the baseline scenario, industrialized countries expect an average minus of 8.0 percent this year. In Italy, Spain and France, the slump is particularly drastic at almost 13 percent each. Great Britain, which is also badly affected by Corona, is expecting a drop of 10.2 percent. In Germany, the experts predict a drop of 7.8 percent. In developing and emerging countries, the drop is 3.0 percent lower. However, there are also significant outliers behind this average, for example in Brazil (-9.1) and Mexico (-10.5). The IMF also warns, like the United Nations before, of rising poverty as a result of Corona. The pandemic means a \"catastrophic blow to the global job market,\" the report said. Low-skilled workers who cannot work from home are particularly affected. The impact on low-income households jeopardized \"significant progress in tackling extreme poverty in the world since the 1990s\". According to the IMF, the forecast is even more uncertain than usual. Finally, it is still unclear to what extent further waves of the infection could occur. Should there be a second outbreak at the beginning of 2021, the effects would be about half as large as in the current year, according to an alternative scenario from the IMF. This is based on the assumption that the number of people potentially affected would then be lower and that, based on previous experience, their protection could be better guaranteed. Also with a view to a possible second wave, the IMF calls for increased international cooperation: \"The world community must act now to prevent this disaster from happening again by building up global stocks of important stocks and protective equipment, funding research and supporting public health systems, and creates effective conditions to bring help to the most needy. \" The G20 debt moratorium is an important first step to help poor countries fight the crisis. According to the IMF, the global economy is expected to grow by 5.4 percent in the coming year. The recovery threatens to be slow. One reason for this is that a voluntary continuation of social distancing could limit consumption for an even longer time. The IMF praises targeted economic stimuli such as the reduction in German VAT and wage replacement benefits such as short-time work as \"good, widespread practices to cushion income losses\". In addition to many risks, the IMF researchers also see a few glimmers of hope. The economy in China is recovering faster than expected. The country of origin of the pandemic is forecast to grow by 1.0 percent this year. The pandemic could also lead to productivity increases. The list of possible improvements ranges from \"new technologies in medicine to generally accelerated digitalization or the switch from fossil to renewable energies\".\n",

            " This article will be updated continuously. Don't miss anything: Subscribe to our Coronavirus newsletter for the latest developments and key background information. 6:52 p.m .: In view of the low number of infections, Switzerland will abolish most of the corona protective measures from Monday: only major events with more than a thousand participants remain prohibited. The government decided that. However, people should keep their distance, now one and a half instead of two meters or less if they wear mouth-nose protection. The curfew is lifted so that night clubs can remain open until the wee hours of the morning. Demonstrations are also allowed again this Saturday, but participants must wear masks. There are no longer any recommendations that older people or those with previous illnesses should work at home. However, hygiene concepts must continue to be adhered to in all publicly accessible locations. 6:29 pm: NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) no longer rules out a regional lockdown after the massive corona outbreak at meat producer Tönnies with hundreds of infected people. The infection process can still be localized. \"If this changes, a comprehensive lockdown in the region may also be necessary,\" said Laschet on Friday evening. He spoke of a massive outbreak. After the virus appeared in a Tönnies plant, the closure of schools and daycare centers has already been ordered in the Gütersloh district. According to previous information, the district wants to avert a lockdown with these and other measures. 5.45 p.m .: The Japanese company Fujitsu has developed a technology that can check compliance with the hygiene requirements for hand washing. With the help of artificial intelligence (AI), the system should be able to recognize whether someone has been washing their hands long enough, between the fingers, around the wrist and also under the fingernails. In their tests, the developers followed the recommendations of the WHO and the Japanese Ministry of Health. 5:35 pm: The Director General of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has warned of an accelerated global spread of the coronavirus. In one day, more than 150,000 new infections were reported to the WHO, more than ever before. Almost half were reported from North, Central and South America, but larger numbers also came from South Asia and the Middle East. \"The world is in a new and dangerous phase,\" said Tedros. \"Many people understandably are fed up with being at home. Countries understandably want to reopen the economy and society. But the virus is spreading quickly, it is still fatal and most people can still get infected.\" Tedros urged all people to keep their distance, wash their hands frequently, and implement other hygiene measures. All infections would have to be tracked down and those affected isolated. 5:15 p.m .: After the slaughter at Tönnies in Rheda-Wiedenbrück has stopped, production will gradually come to an end. The last animals were slaughtered on Wednesday on the instructions of the Gütersloh district. On Friday, the remaining stocks at the headquarters were processed in the areas of beef and sau cutting and onion fat and these areas were shut down, as spokesman André Vielstädte announced. More production lines would now follow. The district administrator of the Gütersloh district had largely quarantined the employees at the headquarters. According to the Tönnies spokesman, an officially ordered work quarantine applies to the necessary employees in the so-called shutdown. The employees may only move between their place of work and their place of residence. The Tönnies plant in Rheda-Wiedenbrück has been largely shut down since Wednesday due to the Corona outbreak. Around 7,000 employees have to be tested for the virus. Infection has so far been detected at 730. 5:00 p.m .: Researchers in Hamburg are currently testing thousands of children for the corona virus. Initial results suggest that young children are less likely to be infected. Why is that, however, is still unclear. 16:35: The statutory health insurance (GKV) posted a billion deficit at the start of the year. After the first three months, there was a minus of 1.3 billion euros, as the Federal Ministry of Health announced on Friday in Berlin. The financial reserves of the 105 health insurers were still 18.3 billion euros at the end of March. This corresponded to an average of 0.83 monthly expenses - at least 0.2 monthly expenses are required by law. Health Minister Jens Spahn (CDU) said: \"The pandemic is also affecting the finances of health insurance companies.\" However, the current figures are not very meaningful, and reliable forecasts can only be made in autumn. \"After many years of financial stability, we have to be prepared for the widening gap between income and expenditure,\" said Spahn. Therefore, there will be an additional federal grant of 3.5 billion euros to the statutory health insurance this year. \"In economically difficult times, this is a good and correct signal for contributors and employers.\" 4:05 pm: For the first time, the European heads of state and government have jointly discussed a 750 billion program proposed by the EU Commission. As expected, however, no agreement was reached on the development plan. Rather, there should be a debate at the video conference, with each country setting out its priorities and red lines. The positions of the 27 EU countries are sometimes still far apart. 3:45 p.m .: The renewed coronavirus outbreak in Göttingen with a quarantine for an entire building complex poses major challenges for the residents and the city. \"We now have to hope that everyone keeps a cool head in this exceptional situation,\" said Christian Hölscher from the youth welfare office in Göttingen on Friday. It is a completely new and drastic situation. Almost 120 coronavirus infections were confirmed within two days, the city said on Friday. There were still about a hundred cases on Thursday. After the new wave of infection became known, the authorities had completely quarantined and sealed off the residential complex in the city center on Thursday. Around 700 residents are affected. Lower Saxony's Minister of Social Affairs Carola Reimann (SPD) urged on Friday to comply with the protection rules. \"These events keep showing us that the pandemic is not over,\" said Reimann. In Göttingen, it is \"a local but massive infection event\". 3.30 p.m .: After the outbreak of coronavirus in Germany's largest slaughterhouse, Tönnies in Rheda-Wiedenbrück, the Bielefeld public prosecutor has received five criminal charges. Among them is an advertisement of the Bielefeld Bundestag member Britta Haßelmann (Greens), Chief Prosecutor Martin Temmen told the German Press Agency on Friday. Several media had previously reported on the ads. It is now being investigated against unknown persons because of the initial suspicion of negligent bodily harm and violation of the Infection Protection Act. 3:20 pm: China has released the genome of the virus strain that caused another corona outbreak in Beijing. The genetic sequence was made available to the World Health Organization (WHO) and scientists around the world on Thursday. The authorities in Beijing said so. 3:05 pm: The Swedes and Finns have started their Midsummer Festival this year. Because of the coronavirus pandemic, many larger events had to be canceled this time, only a few should take place to a very limited extent. Many Scandinavians therefore started the midsummer weekend on Friday with family or smaller friends and preferably at a lake or in nature. The Swedish tourism authority Visit Sweden also started broadcasting celebrations and customs from different parts of the country live on Facebook at noon. Some municipalities also advised to meet online to celebrate together. For many Scandinavians, the arrival of summer is the highlight of the year. For the Swedes, dancing around the midsummer bar, wreaths of flowers on their heads, good food and one or two brandies traditionally belong to the classic holiday ingredients. 2:45 p.m .: Potsdam climate researcher and director of the Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change (MCC), Ottmar Edenhofer, warns of a comeback of fossil fuels in the wake of the corona recession. \"There is a great danger that many governments will switch back to coal electricity to revive the economy,\" he told SPIEGEL. 2.30 p.m .: According to a preliminary evaluation, the number of deaths in Germany fell back to the average of previous years in early May. This was shown by the data available for the 21st calendar week (18 to 24 May), the Federal Statistical Office announced. There had previously been a temporary increase in the coronavirus pandemic. Earlier, from May 4 to 10, mortality had fallen below the average of previous years. The death reports from the registry offices form the basis of the weekly special evaluation. According to the information, there were increased deaths from the 13th to the 18th calendar week (March 23 to May 3). Between April 6th and 12th, the difference was greatest at 14 percent from the four-year average. The number of Covid 19 deaths reported to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) also reportedly peaked during the week. The flu epidemic had little impact compared to previous years, as the Federal Office announced in view of the figures from January through March. There was no noticeable increase. In April, however, the number of deaths with at least 83,000 cases clearly exceeded the average of previous years. 2:10 pm: Two Chinese tourists, who were the first two known coronavirus patients in Italy, donated $ 40,000 to a research institute in Rome. The couple from Wuhan, the source of the crisis in China, have given the money for studies on the virus, the Istituto Spallanzani said on Twitter on Friday. The couple were at a hotel in Rome in late January when they contracted Covid-19. Both were then treated at the institute for weeks before being released in March. After the case became known, Italy stopped all flights to and from China and declared an emergency. It was not until the end of February that further outbreaks of infection became known in northern Italy, which then led to the big outbreak with more than 34,000 deaths.

            " 13.55 p.m .: Almost 1.5 million people in the European Economic Area (EEA) have now been shown to be infected with the corona virus. As updated on Friday morning by the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), 1,498,689 infections and 172,960 deaths have been reported in EEA countries, including the UK. So far, most infections have been recorded in the five most populous countries in the region: Great Britain (300,469), Spain (245,268), Italy (238,159), Germany (188,534) and France (158,641). 1.40 p.m .: According to the United Nations World Food Program, the transport of equipment, relief supplies and emergency workers for the fight against the coronavirus pandemic is at risk; money is apparently missing. Since commercial air traffic is only slowly starting again, UN machines are used for this. The World Food Program - the world's largest humanitarian organization - has so far only received just under 20 percent of the equivalent of 861 million euros that are needed to operate the fleet for the rest of the year. This was announced by a spokeswoman on Friday in Geneva. In the warehouse there were tons of relief goods - enough to fill 120 jumbo jets - that would have to be transported in the next few weeks. In the past few weeks, ventilators, masks and protective suits had also been flown to countries in need. The fleet had headed for 130 destinations and transported around 2,500 emergency workers from more than 80 aid organizations. 1:20 p.m .: The British government's drastic measures to dampen the economic consequences of the corona pandemic have caused the country's public debt to skyrocket above its economic output. By the end of May, according to the ONS statistics office on Friday, debt rose by £ 173.2 billion or 20.5 percent year-on-year to £ 1.95 trillion. This is the strongest percentage increase over a year ago since the monthly records began in 1993. 1:15 pm: India has reported a record increase in the number of new infections. According to the Ministry of Health, a total of 13,500 new cases were counted within 24 hours. More than 300 dead have been registered. Worldwide, only the United States, Brazil and Russia have reported more infections. 1.00 p.m .: After hundreds of coronavirus cases in the Tönnies slaughterhouse in Rheda-Wiedenbrück, the effects are also evident in neighboring regions. In the independent city of Hamm, three school classes were sent to quarantine because there were three children of Tönnies employees among the students who tested positive for Corona. Mayor Thomas Hunsteger-Petermann announced this. According to the notification, the quarantine affects a primary, a secondary and a secondary school. How many Tönnies employees and their families lived exactly in Hamm is open - the city estimates 50 to 100. Already on Wednesday the city of Oelde in the district of Warendorf closed schools and daycare centers as a precaution. Operation is scheduled to resume on Monday. According to the city, information is now available on around 40 Tönnies employees who live in Oelde. The children of these families should be exempted from school and daycare from Monday. The city of Osnabrück orders quarantine for all employees of the company living in the city for 14 days. As the city announced on Friday, it cannot be ruled out that those infected with Tönnies have infected other employees. The quarantine applies to employees working directly at Tönnies as well as employees of subcontractors. Rheda-Wiedenbrück in North Rhine-Westphalia is about 70 kilometers by car from Osnabrück in Lower Saxony. 12.45 p.m .: The federal corona warning app is being used by more and more people in Germany. The number of installations was 9.6 million on Friday morning. This was announced by the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) on Twitter. State Minister for Digital Affairs Dorothee Bär (CSU) called on the population to continue expanding its use. \"Please keep going!\" She wrote on Twitter.

            " In the meantime, the discussion about restrictions of the Corona warning app does not stop. The Greens again criticized that the minimum requirements were too high, so that the app only runs on newer smartphones. So that people with older smartphones can also use the application, Apple and Google would also have to provide their special interfaces for older devices. Apple would have to prepare the so-called API for the iOS 12 operating system, so that devices from 2015 and older are also able to have the Corona warning app installed. 12.25 p.m .: The suspicion that Sars-CoV-2 has been circulating in Europe since the end of last year is borne out: the causative agent was detected in wastewater samples from the two northern Italian cities of Milan and Turin, which had already come from December, according to a statement from Italy's national health institute ISS. This is confirmed by a study that examined wastewater samples in the past few months. 12:10 p.m .: US President Donald Trump's leading coronavirus advisor, Anthony Fauci, believes no further lockdown measures to combat the pandemic in the US are necessary. Speaking to AFP news agency on Thursday, the immunologist said he was optimistic that a vaccine against the novel coronavirus would soon be available to stop the pandemic. Initial tests are \"promising\". Government advisor Fauci rejects additional lockdown measures, despite the United States having the highest number of confirmed Covid-19 infections and coronavirus deaths worldwide. While the Covid 19 outbreaks have largely been brought back under control in the former epicentres of New York and New Jersey, the virus is currently spreading increasingly in 20 countries in the country. In the regions concerned, Fauci advises that existing rules be tightened but no new ones created. \"I don't think we're going to talk about a return to lockdown,\" said Fauci. \"I think we're going to talk about trying to better control the areas of the country where there is an increase in cases seems.\" Districts in the country where there have been no cases so far should be able to reopen their schools, according to Fauci. However, the 79-year-old was reluctant to open the national borders and made no forecast. Trump advisor Fauci: \"I do not think that we will talk about a return to lockdown\" Alex Brandon / dpa 12:00: Because of the spread of the new corona virus, exit restrictions have been imposed on 15 million people in southeastern India. The residents of Chennai, the capital of the state of Tamil Nadu, and surrounding districts must largely stay at home for twelve days, the authorities said on Friday. With the exception of medical emergencies, people are allowed to move a maximum of two kilometers from their home. Grocery stores and petrol stations may only open from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. Population-rich India has so far registered more than 380,000 infections with the novel corona virus, and more than 12,500 people have died. According to experts, however, the number of unreported cases is likely to be significantly higher given the relatively rare corona tests. 11.45 a.m .: The Bundestag has started discussions on the economic stimulus package to deal with the corona crisis. In particular, it is about the temporary reduction in VAT, the child bonus of 300 euros and further relief for companies. \"We will ensure that the economy picks up again,\" said Federal Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) at the start of the debate. \"We react at the right time, specifically and for a limited time.\" 11.35 a.m .: The closings due to the coronavirus pandemic result in drastic losses in sales for innkeepers and hoteliers. In April, the hotel and restaurant industry in Germany made 75.8 percent less money than the year before, as the Federal Statistical Office announced on Friday. From March to April 2020, sales slumped by more than half (56.3 percent). This worsened the situation in the industry after a sharp drop in sales by almost half in March, which was only temporarily affected by the restrictions. The Easter month of April usually promises good business. Instead, according to calculations by the statisticians from Wiesbaden, all branches of the hotel and catering industry recorded the greatest drop in sales since the data were first recorded in 1994. The worst hit was hotels and pensions with a minus of 88.6 percent. In gastronomy, sales fell by 68.5 percent compared to the same month in the previous year. 11.10 a.m .: After the coronavirus outbreak at the meat company Tönnies with more than 730 infected people in the Gütersloh district, District Administrator Sven-Georg Adenauer (CDU) defended the closure of schools and daycare centers. He can understand the \"huge annoyance\" of parents and children, he said on Friday on Deutschlandfunk. But in schools, the virus could \"spread\" through the children of employees to the entire district. The experts would have recommended this. If other areas such as restaurants and sports clubs had been closed at the same time, only \"the protest from other areas would have been even greater,\" said the district administrator. According to his experts, the closure of schools and daycare centers is the \"most effective\" in terms of containment. He also pointed out that he also closed the Tönnies factory after the outbreak. \"This is what I can do.\" 11.00 a.m .: No more minimum distance, instead regular operation in the class association after the holidays: teacher associations are outraged by these plans of the Minister of Education. \"Unrealistic\" is one of the more harmless allegations. Read more about the criticism of the teachers' associations here. 10.45 a.m .: Berlin's senator for culture, Klaus Lederer (left), has promised the cultural enterprises of the capital, which have been particularly hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic, of further millions in aid. The Senate is currently considering extending the emergency aid program launched in May in the amount of 30 million euros by two three-month periods in the same volume, i.e. with a total of 60 million euros, said Lederer on Friday in the RBB's Inforadio. \"That is a realistic number.\" Among the recipients of the Senate aid would be, apart from clubs, variety theater, institutions of the independent scene, small children's and youth theaters and private museums. Clubs are now recognized as cultural sites and the city knows what they have in them, emphasized Lederer. \"I try to do everything to make them survive, but of course I can't give a guarantee.\" According to Lederer, the emergency aid program for clubs and smaller organizers serves to secure liquidity in order to avoid bankruptcies. \"Payments are currently underway.\" It is important to overcome a long dry spell. \"If we don't help now, we end up with a very, very poor cultural landscape.\" Club life is expected to be suspended for a long time due to indoor corona risks. And festivals would probably no longer be possible this year. The abandoned entrance area to the Berlin techno club Berghain (archive picture) 10.25 a.m .: On Friday, the 27 heads of state and government of the EU at the video summit will discuss for the first time the 750 billion euro program presented by Commissioner Ursula von der Leyen for Europe's economy after the corona crisis. At the same time, the next seven-year EU budget with a volume of around 1.1 trillion euros must be tied down because the current budget expires at the end of the year. So it's about the enormous sum of almost two trillion euros. Valdis Dombrovskis, EU Vice-President responsible for the economy, explains in an interview how an agreement should be reached despite the dispute and the lack of time. 10.05 a.m .: The medical and security technology group Drägerwerk increases its production capacities for light respiratory protection in Europe in the course of the coronavirus pandemic. As the group announced on Friday in Lübeck, a completely new plant is to be built in France in Alsace. Existing production sites in Sweden and Germany are also to be expanded. The company put the total investment in new machines at a low double-digit million amount in the current year. Drägerwerk assumes that the long-term demand for light respiratory protection will be higher than before the coronavirus pandemic, said Rainer Klug, the board member responsible for safety technology, according to the announcement. In Sweden, where the group already manufactures respiratory masks, Drägerwerk plans to more than double production to a number in the mid-million range. The group creates additional capacities in Germany, while masks for the whole of Europe are to be manufactured at the new French location in the future. 9.35 a.m .: After the coronavirus outbreak in a Tönnies meat factory with 730 registered new infections, NRW Minister of Health Karl-Josef Laumann (CDU) wants to have the industry examined scientifically. \"We have to investigate how the corona outbreaks arise in the meat industry,\" said Laumann on Friday. \"My ministry will launch scientific expertise that will epidemiologically investigate the causes of the outbreak in Gütersloh.\" Based on the results, \"additional measures might have to be taken,\" Laumann announced.

            " The meat factory is currently closed. According to information from Thursday evening, 1106 results of a series test ordered by the authorities have been evaluated. Around 5,300 employees will still have to be tested at the Tönnies headquarters in the next few days. Corona virus outbreaks have repeatedly occurred in meat factories in recent months, for example in May in a factory in Dissen. 9.30 a.m .: The head of the first clinical study with the coronavirus vaccine from Curevac at the University Hospital in Tübingen is expecting the first results in two months. \"It will be pretty quick,\" said Professor Peter Kremsner, director of the Institute of Tropical Medicine, where the drug is being tested. The patient examinations started on Thursday, but the first vaccination is still pending. The first subject is a young person. \"He'll be monitored in our department for 24 hours,\" said Kremsner. The aim of the first phase of the study is to learn something about tolerance and immune defense. Gradually, more than a hundred healthy volunteers between the ages of 18 and 60 should take part in the study. 9.25 a.m .: Within 24 hours, the health authorities in Germany reported 770 new infections with the corona virus to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). As a result, 188,534 people in Germany have demonstrably contracted Sars-CoV-2 since the beginning of the Corona crisis, as reported by the RKI on Friday morning. According to RKI, 8872 people infected with the virus died in Germany - an increase of 16 compared to the previous day. RKI estimates that around 174,400 people have survived the infection. That is 400 more than the day before. According to RKI estimates with data as of June 18, 00:00, the number of reproductions, or R-value for short, remained unchanged at 0.86 and thus below the critical mark of 1.0. This means that an infected person infects less than another person on average. The R value shows the infection process approximately one and a half weeks beforehand. Since mid-May, the RKI has also been issuing a so-called seven-day R. It refers to a longer period and is therefore less subject to daily fluctuations. According to RKI estimates, this value rose to 1.0 on June 18, 00:00 (previous day: 0.89). It shows the infection from 8 to 16 days ago. 9:20 a.m .: After the new outbreak of coronavirus in Beijing, the number of infected people has increased further. As the state health commission announced on Friday, 25 further infections were detected. Since the new outbreak on a wholesale market in the Chinese capital became known last Thursday, the number of infected people has grown to 183. The new infection numbers on Friday are higher than the day before when 21 cases were officially reported, but below those on Wednesday when the Health Commission said there were still 31 infections. In response to the new outbreak that started at the city's Xinfadi wholesale market last week, the authorities announced the second highest security level on Tuesday, partially sealing off Beijing. 9.15 a.m .: The leading US immunologist in the corona crisis, Anthony Fauci, has doubts about an NFL season this fall. \"When players are not essentially in a bubble - isolated from the community and tested almost daily - it is very difficult to see how football can be played this fall,\" said Fauci, Thursday's CNN data (local time ). \"If there is a second wave that is certainly an option and that would be hampered by the predictable flu season, football may not take place this year.\" Fauci is the director of the National Institute for Infectious Diseases and an advisor to the United States government. The National Football League plans to begin their season on September 10 when Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs play against the Houston Texans. In the past few days, several professionals had tested positive for the corona virus. It is still unclear whether the NFL can start again on schedule in September Brian Blanco / AP 9.10 am: Mexico has reported a record increase in new infections with the corona virus. According to the Ministry of Health, the number of confirmed corona cases rose by 5662 to 165,455 cases. 667 other people died, Mexico has so far totaled 19,747 deaths. However, the government itself assumes a high number of unreported cases. 9.05 a.m .: The revenue of the German tax authorities collapsed by 19.9 percent within a year due to the corona pandemic in May. \"The economic impact of the corona crisis and the tax measures taken as a result of this crisis put a significant strain on tax revenue in May 2020,\" the Federal Ministry of Finance said on Friday in its monthly report. In the first five months of 2020, total revenues decreased by 6.3 percent compared to the same period in the previous year. While sales tax revenue fell by 21 percent in May, wages tax fell by a good ten percent. Due to the almost halted air traffic, the revenue from the air traffic tax even fell by almost 97 percent at 9:00 a.m .: In California, people in public must wear a mask from now on. Governor Gavin Newsom ordered a mask requirement in Thursday's most populous U.S. state to curb the novel corona virus, such as in shops, offices, and local transportation. \"Scientific evidence shows that facewear and masks work,\" the governor said. Newsom was one of the first US governors to impose severe exit restrictions in mid-March. Most recently, however, he gradually eased the conditions again and left the further course of action to the district authorities. However, several districts, such as Orange County south of Los Angeles, resisted the requirement to wear a mask.\n",

            " Until the end of the month, daycare centers in Bavaria are only allowed to look after children in emergency operation, but according to a court order, this is no longer proportionate. The administrative court of Regensburg agreed with a complaining couple and decided that their four-year-old child can now go back to kindergarten. According to the court, the corona pandemic is by no means over and protective measures are still necessary. However, the Bavarian Infection Protection Act no longer provides a sufficient legal basis for the fact that childcare fails and the daycare center can no longer be entered. In view of the long duration of the closure and the current infection rate, the regulations no longer seemed proportionate. The rights of the child and its parents were not sufficiently taken into account. At the moment, less drastic measures such as behavior and hygiene rules are sufficient to contain the risk of infection, the court said. The state government can still lodge an appeal with the Bavarian Administrative Court. The child may be cared for until the contrary is decided. According to the general decree in force in Bavaria, around four fifths of daycare children can now go back to their care because their parents are subject to the large number of exemption rules provided there. The now successful parents with their lawsuit did not fall under the exceptions. The Bavarian government was once again defeated in court with orders to contain the corona pandemic. Most recently, judges already cashed in on the time restrictions for gastronomy in Bavaria; before that, lawsuits against the ban on selling in large shops of more than 800 square meters and against different opening times of restaurants indoors and outdoors were successful.\n",

            " The European Union does not meet the goals it has set itself for climate protection and equality between men and women. This is the result of a report by the EU statistics agency Eurostat. The EU has even moved away from its own goals on gender equality issues in the past five years, according to the report on sustainable development of the EU. The situation of women on the labor market has developed negatively. The recruitment rate for men after training was almost five percentage points higher in 2019 than for women - an increase of almost one percentage point. The only positive thing is that the number of female MPs in national parliaments has increased, said EU Economic Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni. But there is still a long way to go before gender equality is achieved. There has been no progress in climate protection in the same period. For example, greenhouse gas emissions within the EU have only dropped by 2.7 percent in the past five years. The goal of reducing emissions by 40 percent by 2030 compared to 1990 could not be achieved in this way. Climate protection is one of 17 EU sustainability goals. In most other areas, the EU came closer to its goals. The greatest progress has been made in promoting peace and justice. There have also been important achievements in combating poverty and promoting health.\n",

            " A police officer was shot dead in a traffic control in Auckland, New Zealand. A colleague of the man was seriously injured. That is what the police said. Forces therefore searched the city for the shooter. Schools and day care centers near the crime scene were closed. The police did not say why the traffic control took place. The two police officers were unarmed. In New Zealand, it is common for specialized police personnel to carry firearms, for example at the airport or in tactical operations. According to the police, the shooter attacked the two men from the car. During his subsequent escape, a citizen was also slightly injured. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern described the death of the police officer as devastating. \"Losing a police officer means losing someone who works for all of us, but also a family member, a loved one and a friend,\" Ardern said in a statement. After the attack in Christchurch, the New Zealand parliament had tightened its gun laws. Since then, the sale of semi-automatic weapons and semi-automatic rifles has been banned. Australian Brenton Tarrant is accused of killing 51 people and injuring dozens of people in the attack on two mosques in the city in March last year.\n",

            " At first glance, Horst Seehofer's intention to report a columnist \"as Federal Minister of the Interior\" seems like populist Kraftmeierei somewhere in the anti-press Bermuda triangle between Trump, Putin and Orbán. Seehofer praised Trump in 2017, kept publicizing his closeness to Putin and defended the professional anti-Semite Orbán in 2019 and was counterfactually flattered as \"Democrats\". However, a different reading of the events is also possible: Seehofer is less anti-authoritarian and anti-press, rather he has failed a PR stunt. Because he lost his excellent populist flair. In order to understand this, one has to take an analytical look into the toolbox of political communication. Agenda cutting is the name of a communication strategy with which undesirable topics are to be pushed out of the public eye. Donald Trump has developed a certain mastery in letting his misconduct, lies and monstrosities tumble out of the media's focus of attention. Who still remembers the excitement shortly before Trump thought about dropping atomic bombs on hurricanes. Or to buy Greenland. Immediately before the debate on the \"taz\" column, two issues dominated the mass and social media media: the impression that Philipp Amthor was affordable and \"Black Lives Matter\", the worldwide movement against racist police violence. Both are topics that are not particularly pleasant for Seehofer. Philipp Amthor is a conservative young hope, there are not many of this kind in the CDU. Especially not those who defend themselves against Problemhofer in critical situations. Amthor jumped at the Federal Minister of the Interior after he claimed that the migration question was the mother of all political problems in Germany. The saying from his environment is quoted in the media: \"Horst Seehofer has an elephant memory. He forgets nothing - and forgives nothing\". Urban Zintel, born in 1975, is an author and strategy consultant specializing in the Internet and digital technologies. In 2019 Kiepenheuer & Witsch published his book \"Reality shock: ten lessons from the present\". In his \"Debate Podcast\", Lobo responds to letters about his columns. It seems even clearer how much the debate about racist police violence has annoyed the Federal Minister of the Interior. The discussion seemed to be starting from George Floyd to the German police. Horst Seehofer could have taken this as an opportunity to push the police as top employer violently to investigate local cases. For example, the death of the asylum seeker Oury Jalloh, who did the fatal feat of tying his arms and legs tied to a fireproof mattress in a prison cell. Without leaving any traces on the lighter that was found two days later. Or in the case of Amad Ahmad, who was innocently imprisoned and burned there in Kleve because of a name confusion. But Seehofer is the German personification of \"Blue Lives Matter\". This is the US battle cry for those who, with the best will in the world, can not detect racist police murders. The displacement of unwanted topics by agenda cutting does not have to be planned or arranged for a long time. Rather, it is a populist reflex to torpedo discussions in which you can gain little with your own positions. Seehofer's unease with \"Black Lives Matter\" and the reports about Amthor escapades should be enough to motivate him. The fact that Seehofer has made a connection between the \"taz\" column and the riot in Stuttgart - as if young, drunken men from the Stuttgart party scene read the \"taz\" between the lines and understand it as an invitation - testifies to the unscrupulousness of the interior minister. Especially because this same Seehofer was much less upset about the Nazi devastation of Leipzig Connewitz. Agenda cutting works best with spectacular exaggeration, because it stimulates the mutual side to contradict itself sharply. It is only through a polyphonic exchange of blows that the volume of discourse that you need to suppress other topics is created. This increases the urge among journalists to express or protest. In any case, it is a serious problem that the public machinery consisting of social and editorial media will only be able to deal with about one and a half topics in 2020 at the same time, and usually not for very long. In Helmut Kohl's day, sitting out meant ignoring media attacks for months. Today, an afternoon without cell phone reception in Brandenburg is sometimes enough to sit out. Especially when a new, big topic dominates social media and headlines. Nevertheless, Seehofer may have miscalculated this time. His attempt at agenda cutting worked more or less technically by suppressing the two issues that were unfavorable for the Union. Nobody talks about Amthor anymore. But Seehofer has failed to recognize how sensitive the issue of press freedom has become - also for Angela Merkel. And how loud the resistance when a government member so obviously measures with two standards. Agenda cutting is hardly helpful if the new topic can become even more unpleasant than the old one. The announced announcement by a Federal Minister of the Interior is a self-trap for Seehofer, because now every press statement that he does not display can be stamped with the Seehofer stamp of official acceptance. You can hardly act more clumsily in legal and media terms. If something turns out to be inaccurate, half-wrong or complete curd, one says on the Internet: not well aged - a reference to the American \"aged like milk\". Federal Interior Minister Horst Seehofer has not aged well as a political concept. Seehofer has aged a little worse than milk. This does not allude to his physical age of seventy, but to his political age. Horst Seehofer consists of a 20th century concentrate. His time is long gone. He had briefly suspected that this was due to the change in the public. Because Seehofer is German champion in feeling unjustly treated, he said: \"We don't have to look at Russia. Most fake news are produced in Germany, by both the media and politicians.\" In the summer of 2018, he announced that he would finally want to tweet himself: \"I now feel compelled, because otherwise I cannot get some truths among a broader population\". After a turbulent year with an incredible two tweets, he gave up. The community communicates \"flat and flat, spiteful and malicious\". This is not entirely out of thin air, but is surprising for a man who just said: \"There are beer festivals where people just want you to be attacked on others\". He took part in it, but: \"I never drove home satisfied.\" With such glaring remorse, you even suffer as a nasty Twitterer with tears in your bags. Afterwards Seehofer thought: \"Gosh, you killed one now, hopefully he understands why.\" The hollow remorse of the schoolyard thug who complains with self-pity about his little fists that hurt from being beaten. Actually perfect conditions for a brilliant Twitter career. The fact that he never found access to the new public as a whole is now taking its toll. His mistake was to underestimate the impact of a social and media-oriented public. Not that his traditional instruments have become completely ineffective. But he has lost his feeling for media productions. He completely ignored the fact that Merkel could not allow Seehofer to make Erdogan by press announcement in view of the symbolic and signal effect. The journalistic public has developed further. Many social media campaigns are now politically effective, there is a noticeable, political pressure from social media, especially through the interaction with editorial media. This pressure can hardly be mastered with Seehoferschem, i.e. old-fashioned agenda cutting. There is a reason why Trump arrives with atomic bombs, because in 2020 only crazy spectacle will be able to exert sufficient force. And there's a reason Trump is getting away with it: he's president. Seehofer, on the other hand, has a supervisor with policy competence. The big question is whether Seehofer's long-offended populist pride can withstand further degradation from the Chancellor's Office.\n",

            " After the riots in Stuttgart, eight suspected rioters are in custody, one of them on suspicion of attempted manslaughter. A judge issued the arrest warrants, said a spokesman for the prosecutor. Another arrest warrant had been suspended against conditions. In the night of Sunday, hundreds of people had moved through Stuttgart's central shopping street, destroyed shop windows and looted shops. According to the police, 400 to 500 people were involved in the riot. Investigators had already announced on Monday that a 16-year-old had been tried for homicide. He is said to have deliberately kicked a student lying on the floor who had criticized the riots and was beaten up. The investigators accuse the young person of at least accepting the possible death of the victim. According to the police, the men between the ages of 16 and 33 have German, Croatian, Iraqi, Portuguese and Latvian citizenship. They are accused of violating the peace, as well as dangerous bodily harm, physical attacks on law enforcement officers and theft in a particularly serious case. 16 allegedly initially arrested suspects were released. The city, state and police are still looking for answers to the question of why violence suddenly broke out in the middle of the night. While there is still talk of an uninhibited party scene, others point to the consequences of the Corona requirements, the lack of respect for law enforcement officers and the desire to show off videos and photos on social media.

            " When ships sail across the ocean, they emit huge clouds of exhaust gas. What emerges from the chimneys of container giants, tankers and cruise ships contains not only carbon dioxide, sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides that are harmful to the climate, but also soot and ultrafine dust. The combustion of heavy oil causes the smallest particles to get into the lower atmosphere. They are harmful to human health. If you look down on the earth from space, you can see the pollution of the oceans well under certain conditions: Because the large merchant ships mostly sail the ocean on very specific routes, long, thin cloud patterns form over these traffic routes, the researchers call it \"ship tracks \"(ship tracks). Such patterns off the Portuguese coast can be seen on the satellite image of the week, which was taken by the Nasa satellite Aqua. For decades, scientists have suspected that these cloud formations could change the climate by influencing the solar radiation on the earth's surface. The suspicion: While the high emissions of climate-damaging gases contribute to global warming, cloud formation could have an opposite, namely cooling effect. To get to the bottom of this thesis, a team led by climate researcher Michael Diamond from the University of Washington measured how ship emissions affect cloud formation regionally. For this purpose, the scientists examined the sky over a heavily used shipping route in the Southeast Atlantic for more than ten years. They evaluated satellite data and compared it with estimates for a non-shipping scenario. Diamond and his colleagues found that the heavy traffic at sea actually increased the number of cloud droplets. They were also able to show that these clouds reduced the solar energy reaching the surface of the sea by around two watts per square meter. The team's results were consistent with previous computer models that had predicted a significant cooling effect from shipping. According to Diamond, water vapor condenses on the exhaust gas particles from the chimneys of the ships and forms small cloud droplets. These droplets make the clouds lighter so that they reflect more sunlight, which in turn creates a local cooling effect on the earth's surface. \"Ship tracks are a prime example of how tiny pollution particles in the atmosphere can affect the properties of clouds,\" says Diamond. However, in order to understand the effect this has on the climate, one has to look at the effects of shipping traffic over a long period of time. The following figure first shows the average cloud droplet concentration observed by the Nasa satellites Aqua and Terra from 2003 to 2015 (the small box contains the shipping route investigated by the researchers): In the second figure, the estimated cloud droplet concentrations for the examined shipping route are the same Period without shipping traffic illustrated (see small box). These values ​​were calculated on the basis of statistical patterns from nearby, unpolluted areas: According to the researchers, the influence of cloud formation on the average temperature on a regional scale is rather small. However, since many other industrial pollution sources worldwide contribute to such a phenomenon in addition to ships, the global average temperature can certainly be influenced. \"Cloud changes caused by industrial pollution have created a global cooling effect that is about one-third the rate of warming from increased greenhouse gases,\" said Diamond.\n",

            " \"The corona crisis is like climate change,\" says Jasper Meya, 32, short-cut, dark brown curly hair, a doctor of environmental economics. Everyone has to limit themselves - for the good of all. In the case of climate change, this means: leave your car behind, do without meat, consume less. At Corona: wear a mask, keep your distance, stay at home. Economists speak of external costs, the effects of which may appear small when viewed individually, but work together with force. This is particularly evident in the corona crisis. Despite the gradual easing, the defined limit of 50 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants is met almost everywhere within seven days. A quarter of the circles have not reported a case in the past seven days. Scientists had expected the number of cases to increase if the restrictions were relaxed. Do masks contain the infection? The weather? The canceled major events? Everything is possible, says Meya, who works as an environmental economist at the German Center for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) and the University of Leipzig. However, one factor is often neglected in the calculation because it is difficult to calculate: the person. According to initial study results from researchers at iDiv and the universities of Leipzig, Hamburg and Kiel, on which Meya has worked, voluntary contact restrictions are likely to be sufficient to curb the corona pandemic in Germany. Usually, the scientific team does not research viruses, but rather economic questions about sustainable economics and climate change. However, the question of the greatest possible benefit for everyone can also be transferred to the current crisis, which is why Corona is now part of the research area of ​​the scientists. At the end of March, the researchers asked more than 3,500 people in Germany whether they avoided contact with others because of the corona crisis and why. They then fed a model that simulates the spread of diseases with the results of the representative survey. Result: In order to protect themselves from infection, most people had reduced their personal contacts on their own - before the contact restrictions were put in place. On average, the respondents stated that they only encounter a quarter of the people in their everyday lives compared to before the pandemic. According to the simulations, the voluntary contact restriction would probably have been sufficient to stabilize the number of new infections and to keep the reproductive factor at 1. This means that on average each infected person would have infected only one other person, and the pandemic would have been contained. The research group uploaded their study results to a science server. The first feedback from other researchers is positive, says Meya. A real review of the study, which is actually common in science before publication, is already underway. The researchers submitted their study to a renowned specialist journal. Other data also suggest that voluntary contact restrictions were crucial in the fight against the pandemic. Cellular data confirm that in mid-March millions of people were only half as much on the road in Germany as usual. Contact bans that started on March 23 did not produce any measurable additional effect. The estimated reproductive factor had also dropped to 1 before the restrictions were imposed. Critics of the Corona measures use this as an argument that the temporary lockdown in Germany was pointless. Right? \"Our analyzes show that the pandemic would probably have been contained by voluntary contact restrictions,\" says Meya. \"But at a high price.\" According to the researchers' model, a hundred times more people would have been infected, and the number of deaths associated with a corona infection would be about 15 times higher. In order to contain the pandemic with the least damage to society, the restrictions should have been even stricter according to the calculations. To do this, the number of infections should first have been depressed so that on average less than one in 100,000 people are acutely infected. If everyone had met only about a third of the people after the pandemic, the number of reproductions would have remained at 1. When the first rules were relaxed, Germany had not yet reached this value. At that time, researchers at the Helmholtz Center for Infection Research in Braunschweig had also spoken out in favor of pushing the number of cases even further in order to return to normality more quickly. So did the easing come too early? \"You can't say that in general,\" says Meya. \"We base our analyzes on a model. In reality, many other factors play a role. The fact that the number of cases remains so low indicates the success of the easing.\" The federal states have at least partially opened daycare centers and schools, as well as restaurants, cafés and hotels, without the infection numbers increasing significantly. However, weeks may pass before the effects of the easing are shown in the statistics. The fact that premature easing can lead to a renewed increase in the number of cases is currently evident in Iran, where the number of cases is rising again significantly. President Hassan Rohani rules out another shutdown despite the new wave of infections - the fear of the economic consequences is too great. In the United States, too, the number of cases is increasing in 22 states. Donald Trump does not want to do without his planned public appearances. He also ruled out another lockdown. The virus is dying, the US President said in an interview recently. \"Our analyzes show that voluntary contact restrictions can significantly slow down the infection process,\" says Meya. \"But relying on her alone is risky.\" As long as the number of infections is high, people are more likely to refrain from contacts in order to protect themselves and others. But what if the numbers drop again like now in Germany? Evaluations of mobile data show that people are on the move again more. \"Many people are becoming less careful, for example, they sit on the subway without a mask,\" said Mayor of Berlin-Neukölln, Martin Hikel, in an interview with SPIEGEL. Infection numbers have recently risen again in Berlin. The number of cases will probably increase further due to late registrations, the Senate Department for Health announced on request. It is unclear whether the \"Black Lives Matter\" demonstrations or inflatable boat parties play a role. \"We still have to assume that there is a significant risk of infection with Covid-19 in people,\" writes the Senate administration. Because the participants often come from different locations, the effects of rallies are difficult to read anyway, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) said on request. Overall, however, the risk of infection outdoors is significantly lower than in closed rooms. In fact, the current outbreaks seem to be mainly due to cramped living conditions. The latest outbreak in Berlin affects several apartment buildings in Neukölln, in which ten people share a three-room apartment. Cramped living conditions could also have contributed to the outbreak at the Tönnies meat factory in Gütersloh. The group denies the allegations. According to Tönnies, Polish and Romanian employees were probably infected with the virus when traveling home over the long weekend on Corpus Christi. However, experts doubt this explanation. Individual weekend visits cannot explain such a large number of new infections, said infectiologist Isabella Eckerle from the University of Geneva to the news agency dpa. The incubation period is too long for that. The numbers suggest a recent outbreak that has only just been discovered. Such local outbreaks do not change the risk of infection for the whole of Germany - as long as they are quickly brought under control. But they prove that the virus is still there. Everyone decides whether outbreaks will occur again, a bit like climate change.\n",

            " A New York father, whose one-year-old twins died of heat, is spared a prison sentence. The prerequisite is that he is not arrested for other offenses within a year. Among other things, the man had been charged with negligent homicide and manslaughter. Ultimately, however, according to media reports, the responsible public prosecutor no longer tried to convict her. It was a tragic, unfortunate incident, she said. The man had previously pleaded guilty to negligence. He had left the kids in a car last July with outside temperatures up to 30 degrees while working an eight-hour shift. During the trial, the man testified that he thought he had given the children to the care before work. But the twins were sitting in the back seat behind him when he parked the car in front of his job, a Bronx hospital. After his shift, he got back into the car to drive home. A little later he discovered his dead children. The New York Times wrote that he got out of the car and shouted. A witness called 9:00 p.m. Before the investigative authorities, the man had initially pleaded not guilty. He said he had a total dropout. \"My babies are dead. I killed my babies.\" The children's mother had spoken of a \"terrible accident\" after the twins' death. She had said she needed her husband by her side to get through it all. They would also have to look after their other children. \"He has five children - now three - and they're all just outraged,\" the 39-year-old's lawyer told CNN. Friends would describe his client as the \"father of all fathers\".\n",

Accordingly, parents and passersby noticed the child's disappearance only a few moments later. They immediately started looking for and alerting the emergency services. According to the fire brigade, these were used with divers and a boat on the lake in the municipality of Rhauderfehn in East Frisia within a short time. Divers would have found the boy after a few minutes. He was resuscitated and flown to a hospital by helicopter. The boy died there in the evening. The child's age was not disclosed.\n",

            " As if the spread of a virus were not enough, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) now expects another disease that has not played a major role in Germany until recently: the West Nile virus is transmitted by mosquitoes and is loud RKI apparently able to spend the winter in Germany. The first transmissions within Germany were reported last year. Five people had been infected with the West Nile virus in the affected area in eastern Germany (Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt and Berlin). Experts assume that there were probably hundreds more without knowing it. Previously, the pathogen had only been detected in vacationers in rare cases. The West Nile virus is transmitted by the mosquitoes of the genus Culex, which are widespread in Germany, and causes symptoms, mainly fever or rash, in around 20 percent of infected people. Only about one percent of infections lead to serious illnesses that affect the nervous system. It was a serious infection, said virologist Jonas Schmidt-Chanasit in an interview with SPIEGEL at the end of October. \"The virus will keep us busy for years to come.\" \"Experience with the West Nile virus in southern European countries suggests that it will establish itself in Germany and will probably continue to spread,\" says the current epidemiological bulletin of the RKI. Longer summers with high temperatures in particular could therefore contribute to a longer season and a wider spatial spread. The experts named the heat-favored region on the Upper Rhine as a possible risk area, where mosquito pests have been combated for years. The West Nile virus occurs in different regions of the world, among other things it caused large outbreaks in North America, but also in South and Southeast Europe, and was introduced from there to Germany. In addition to humans, mammals (especially horses) and birds can be infected with the virus through mosquito bites. Last year, 51 cases in birds and 32 in horses were reported. In 2018 there were only ten cases in birds and two in horses. So far there are no vaccines or specific therapy for humans. Infections can only be prevented by mosquito repellent.\n",

The man initially broke through a traffic control in Winterthur and fled, according to a statement from the authorities. The police also shot. The flight in the car therefore ended after just a few kilometers in an accident. The man then fled on foot before pouring a flammable liquid on him and setting it on fire. The fire brigade extinguished the fire, and the young man was hospitalized with serious injuries. Two police officers were also injured in the incident.

            " The virus really messed up our lives. When the corona restrictions began in mid-March, most people's daily lives changed dramatically within a few days. Schools and kindergartens, bars and clubs, restaurants, cinemas and gyms closed. Concerts and soccer games were canceled. Instead of going to work, many stayed in the home office, some jobs were suddenly indispensable - and in others there was suddenly nothing to do. But how are those affected? How did Corona change your everyday life? What fears and problems did he bring? And how did you deal with it? It shouldn't be about infected people, but about the social consequences of the pandemic. We called the victims of the corona crisis the first idea for this piece. In keeping with the title of the series \"Heroes of Everyday Corona\". We always said \"working title\". Somehow it was clear to us from the beginning that \"victim\" is a rather violent term. Did we only expect people who stared at the ruins of their existence, waited for Corona to be over and everything to go on as before? Certainly not. It wasn't easy to find people who were willing to talk to us about their situation and the challenges that had come with the lockdown. Clear. Success is easier to report than problem. Many of the people we contacted said they found it very important to ask people how they were doing and make them heard - but they couldn't do it themselves. Two initially provided information, but then withdrew their logs. \"When I read that,\" one of the two wrote, \"phew. I don't want it to be published.\" That is understandable. Because it takes courage to reveal yourself in such a vulnerable situation. At the same time it is a shame, because the story of this person is also a success story. Most have managed to find and find ways to keep going in the past few weeks. No wide streets, but paths full of difficult to see bends and dangerous precipices, through thickets and over stumbling blocks. Paths that require courage and strength. The expected protocols of need also became a group of optimists, creatives and fighters. Martina Schenk, 57, yoga teacher and trainer for rehabilitation sports \"When the lockdown started, it was like a blow to the head. It started on Friday. I have six clients, including gyms, rehabilitation centers, physiotherapy practices and a church parish - and until Sunday one after the other told me: From now on, classes can no longer take place. I was really afraid of loss. I then applied for \"Emergency Aid 2\" and received it relatively quickly. But as of today it is not clear in Berlin whether that I have to put some of the money back on a savings book until it is cleared up. I have to pay tax on the amount as well. At the moment I am going to my reserves, which are only limited. In the meantime, I was afraid that I have to go back to my old job. I worked in a tax office for a long time. But that would not be a good alternative. What I do now is not a job for me change a vocation. Fortunately, participants wrote to me and called, encouraging me. They asked: Can't we somehow let the courses take place anyway? So I discovered Zoom for myself and started teaching about it. \"They felt totally alone and deserted\" Many of my participants are well over sixty. Some of them have no husband anymore. Some felt totally alone and abandoned and were happy to be able to participate on the Internet. And I have to honestly say: Despite contact restrictions, I went to one or the other, got the laptop and set it up for them. Fortunately, the gyms are now open again. But although I could comply with all hygiene measures, some of my clients do not open their rooms for fear of Corona. Distance can be guaranteed, we can disinfect our hands, we have the opportunity to ventilate. Shopping is not that safe. Sure, everyone has a mouthguard, but some have their noses free. And when you are in the supermarket, the others are not a meter and a half apart. Three courses a week now run via Zoom. If you can pay for something, you pay for what and if you can't pay for anything, you don't pay for anything. I am happy that I can help, that they feel good and have no pain. \"Fredi Börger, 35, private seafood bar operator\" Last year I had a food truck. In February I opened my own shop \"Yamacito Seafood Bar\" in St. Peter-Ording. When I heard that major events were being canceled because of Corona, I still thought: my poor food truck colleagues, they are really pinched when there are no events. A week later the restaurant was closed everywhere and the lockdown caught me too. I'm more of an optimist and tried to make the best of time. I took out a loan to take over the shop and built a small buffer into my calculation. I used the time to tighten each screw a second time. I rebuilt everything the way I wanted it to. I still had sleepless nights. In mid-April I was allowed to open my shop again. Because fish rolls are mostly sold outside the home, I was able to start a little earlier than others. However, since no second home owners and tourists were allowed to travel, the sales were of course not that great. \"Now it starts first\" But of course it doesn't happen that you have an entire beach to yourself. Usually the beach at St. Peter-Ording is always full of people. Even the locals said they had never seen anything like it here. Another lockdown would be a disaster for me. I would probably survive the time because I have made an agreement with my landlord that in the event that Corona causes me financial difficulties, I can pay my rent later. But what would be a lot of debt together with the loan I already have. But now it starts. Day guests can come back. And people are really up for the North Sea. I have heard from hoteliers and apartment rental companies that some of them are fully booked by autumn. Sihna Maagé, 27, singer and songwriter \"I have been touring clubs, studios and smaller pubs with my songs for years. After completing my studies in 2019, I said to myself: 2020 will be your year! I wanted to go on tour that Bookings have started and at the same time I have prepared a crowdfunding to record a CD. Anyone who has done this before knows how much work you have to do in such a project - for the band and the studio production, the graphics and everything around I need several thousand euros. Concerts were planned to generate reach and attention. On March 1st we pressed the start button and started the advertising - and two weeks later Corona came in. \"It just feels like shit \"All events and live gigs were canceled. The wedding season in spring, the festivals in summer - everything was canceled. That was a catastrophe for me. You invest time, creativity and a lot of love in such a project, and then there is one rejection after the other. This is just howling. And I can't even be mad at someone. It just felt like shit. I am still relatively well, I live with my boyfriend and know that this will secure my rent if necessary. A friend of mine, who is also a musician and lives alone, has nothing at the moment. Not a single cent. It is so bitter. I am currently active on social media. Everyone is doing online concerts at the moment, but I'm trying to keep it visible. And it is touching when one of my singing students, who I am currently teaching online, supports the CD production with a small amount of his pocket money. I just hope that I can play again soon - in front of a real audience, in a real concert hall. \"Ricarda Sitan, 41, and Freia Vogel, 29, midwives\" Most people think that midwives are a crisis-proof job. 'Everything is fine with you, babies always come.' In a way, that's true. With only two birthing centers in Hamburg, the demand is generally very high and is currently rising because the women are afraid to go to a hospital. Not only because of the risk of infection, but also because of the corona-related circumstances: In some delivery rooms, women have to wear a mask at birth. But you cannot give birth to a child with a mask on your face if you breathe hard and work hard. And in some clinics, even the partners are not allowed to be in the delivery room - but when you are born, you need a trusted person at your side. Despite all the alleged 'crisis security', midwives and birthing centers had to struggle before Corona with poor pay from health insurers and high ancillary costs. Liability insurance for a midwife currently costs around 8,600 euros a year and increases by another ten percent in July. There are also costs for quality management, rents and equipment maintenance. In addition, prices for protective materials such as disinfectants, masks and gloves have risen massively. \"In order to get through, we would have to invest\" The birth house could therefore only be maintained through many additional offers: courses, advice, training for midwives. Financially, it has always been tight. There shouldn't be any surprises. And I don't mean Corona, but the washing machine and dryer break at the same time. Since Corona, only the preparatory courses have taken place. And also only with a smaller number of participants - because of the safety distance. With more supervised births, we could get the birth house through the Corona period. But for that we would have to invest and equip the course room in such a way that it can be used as a second full birth room in just a few steps. But the second heart tone recorder alone that we need costs 5000 euros. We just can't afford that at the moment. That is why we are trying a fundraiser and hope that we can get through with the changed structure, especially since we already have registrations by February 2021 and now have to make decisions. \"Peter Vyge, 45 years, photographer and communication designer Fotografie_ManuH / Fotografie-ManuH \"Last year I had a permanent job, but then the company quit. At first I didn't think much about it. I thought that I would quickly find a new job and also wanted something new. But I had no idea of ​​Corona. My wife and I have a young daughter. She is two and a half years old and has not been allowed to go to her daycare for weeks, recently three days a week. When the facility closed from one day to the other in mid-March, I had just completed a multi-month online training sponsored by the employment office, initially with attendance on site - later on my home computer: every day from 8.30 a.m. to 4.15 p.m. But because a toddler is demanding dad's attention all the time, I only got half of the material. I had to cancel the training. My wife has a permanent position, is professionally challenged and must be able to work in peace. That's why I took over most of the childcare. \"The unemployment benefit expires at the beginning of January.\" At first I saw the positive aspect: that I can now take care of the little one without any problems. I enjoy spending the days with her. But the longer this situation lasts, the less I know how to get out of unemployment. Many companies have a hiring freeze, and even if I find a job, I can't promise the boss at the moment that my child can go to daycare five days a week in the foreseeable future. All the time I have the feeling that time is on my neck. Financially we are still doing quite well. But at the beginning of January the unemployment benefit expires, then I slip into nothing. Because my wife deserves, I wouldn't even get Hartz IV. I could work as a freelancer, but that is only possible if the little one can go to daycare. I am an optimistic person, but this uncertainty strains me. I feel left alone by politics on that point. Sometimes that pulls me down, sometimes my wife. But we are a good team, support each other and encourage each other. This is very important at this time. \"Nina Schaft, 26, law student and self-employed legal assistant\" I lived in Cologne until the end of March. In a one-bedroom apartment, very, very small, but affordable. And just a ten minute walk to the university. Then Corona came. In addition to my studies, I work independently as a legal assistant. But from February there was less and less to do, so that I had almost no orders in March. In addition, my father supported me with 100 euros per month. He is also self-employed and works for the trade fair in Cologne. But everything went wrong and he was on the verge of bankruptcy. After a lot of thought, I decided at short notice to give up the apartment and move back to my mother. I still remember meeting friends at a breakfast bar on March 16. Those from the restaurant got the notification that day that they had to close the next day. It all happened so quickly that I was really scared. I just wanted to move through quickly because I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to get out of the apartment with a complete lockdown. I also needed people to help me. A maximum of two weeks passed from the decision to the move out. \"There is a bus in Voiswinkel once an hour\" Now I live with my mother and my two brothers in Voiswinkel, a village near Bergisch Gladbach. It is unusual. I am 26 and I would say that I am an adult, self-reliant woman - and then back to the children's room, which gives me the feeling that I have failed. Even if it is actually not so. A bus runs once an hour in Voiswinkel. With waiting times and changes, I now need 90 minutes to go to university. At the moment this is still possible because everything is digital, so I only have to go to Cologne to work. But when the face-to-face events start again, it will be a completely different situation. I definitely want to live in Cologne again, but I don't know if I can do it before my exam - that would be in two to three years. Sahin Saray, 54, taxi driver \"It was my last working day on March 20th. I waited six hours at the airport and had a turnover of EUR 29. Since then, driving a taxi has not been worthwhile and I don't want to endanger my family. Until then I always have 80 Worked hours a week, twelve hours a day. I applied for and received emergency Corona help. But that is a flash in the pan for a family of four. It helped until May. But I don't know what will happen in the next few months. At the moment we are getting help from the employment office. For rent, electricity and water. \"Driving a taxi is still not worth it.\" But soon the money will be gone and then we will have nothing to live on. And my operating expenses continue - vehicle costs, insurance, vehicle tax , Employers' liability insurance association, garage rental, and driving a taxi is still not worth it. I only spoke to a colleague a few days ago, and he earned 40 euros in ten hours d 25 machines a day, previously it was ten to 20 an hour. I read a lot to relax and think about something else, play keyboard and guitar, I like to paint. But still: At some point, boredom catches up with me. Then I go out, but life outside is no longer the same as before. My wife and children support me, but I am very worried about my existence - as a father, as a husband, as an entrepreneur. For us taxi drivers in Hamburg won't be normal anytime soon. We have no major events. All the musicals and hotels are closed. Football, Schlagermove, concerts - everything will not take place until further notice. \"Paul Krämer, 30, freelance choir director\" In Bonn I conduct the Philharmonic Choir, in Cologne the Kartäuserkantorei, both are ensembles in which laypeople sing. We usually rehearse for several months and then there is a concert. The other day it would have happened: works by Handel and Bach, as soloists and in the orchestra, professional musicians were engaged. I had to cancel everyone. Of course it was very sad for the choir singers and me. I'm lucky, my fees come from the membership fees of the singers. But other colleagues and musicians are hit harder by the situation. Their existence depends on the concerts, the fees. Some teach alongside, but this is often just an additional income. In many musician households, all reserves and retirement reserves are melting together. State aid programs are often of little use: they are intended for operating costs, but not for living expenses. Musicians usually have no company cars or offices. And the default fees that the federal government provides are only given to those who received state funding before Corona. \"What is at stake is missing\" We need new ways of fundraising for our colleagues. If their professional existence collapses, there will also be no numerous concerts in the future. In the first weeks of the pandemic, I sent music files by email so that the singers could rehearse their sounds. In the meantime, we meet for a video conference every week: because of the feedback, all of their microphones turn off, only mine is in operation, I play the piano, explain where you breathe, but don't hear what the singers sing. So what is at stake, the choral sound, the common music, is missing. But it is better than nothing. I hope that at least at the end of June we can rehearse in a room with a few singers. By far, of course, and only with those who are ready. I find it difficult to play concerts, so far the choir has been pushing up on the pedestal and the orchestra is in front of it. Maybe we can only offer concerts outside in the fresh air. The normality to which we all want to return will definitely need new formats for the future. \"Recorded by Silke Fokken, Armin Himmelrath, Benjamin Maack and Katja Thimm\n",

            " It's not about Covid-19, Mers, Sars or Ebola. It's about tuberculosis (TB), the deadliest of all infectious diseases, which kills over 1.5 million people every year, including more than 200,000 children. Once upon a time, \"consumptiveness\" was rampant in Europe too, in part it was romanticized like in the \"camellia lady\" or, with an ironic undertone, in Thomas Mann's \"Zauberberg\", whose novel hero Hans Castorp philosophizes: \"Illness is, in a sense, something venerable, if I do so may say. \" Fortunately, the medical doctor Robert Koch discovered the pathogen, the Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1905. Greek nurses learn how to deal with tuberculosis sufferers (1949) Today, tuberculosis has largely been forgotten in industrialized countries, but it is still rampant in poorer regions of the world. The consumption is simply not going to go away, on the contrary. Experts estimate that around a fifth of the world's population is infected with TB, but it is often only a \"silent infection\" without symptoms. Because as long as the immune system is strong enough, it can keep the pathogens at bay. But if stress such as malnutrition or HIV infection is added, TB often breaks out with full force. Six countries contribute to 60 percent of new cases: India, Indonesia, China, Nigeria, Pakistan and South Africa. More than 500 drug and intervention studies are currently underway on Covid-19, and that's a good thing. The situation is very different with tuberculosis. The world's biggest killer is largely ignored. This lack of attention is now taking its toll. The corona efforts lead to a further reinforcement of the already existing tunnel view, at the expense of the fight against tuberculosis. The willingness to donate decreases, patients can no longer be treated, the once planned eradication by 2030 can hardly be achieved, warns medical doctor Mel Spigelman, head of the non-governmental organization TB Alliance, in a zoom conversation with SPIEGEL: \"If we could tuberculosis Exterminate in 2030? Sure! Can we do that with today's efforts? No way! \". The global community could make huge strides in the fight against tuberculosis for just about $ 15 billion a year in research, diagnosis and treatment, and avoid gigantic consequential damages, said Lucica Ditiu, director of the international \"Stop TB Partnership\" campaign. . Forever vacation Because of regular business: Why the school chaos continues Instead the world community is waiting. And watches the problem worsen. Multi-resistant strains of tuberculosis are on the rise, especially in Eastern Europe. But the world is looking away, Ditiu says on the phone: \"I am angry and frustrated.\" She too was infected with TB while traveling, actually she wanted to start therapy in the spring, but due to the corona crisis she had to postpone her own treatment. A glimmer of hope: Little has changed in tuberculosis therapy for around 30 years, now something is moving. In the United States, pretomanide, a new drug, was approved as a combination therapy. It was not developed by a pharmaceutical company, but for the first time by a non-profit organization, namely the above-mentioned TB Alliance. The new anti-tuberculosis drug could soon also receive EU approval. It would be a small success in the midst of a big tragedy. Hans Castorp from \"Zauberberg\" was completely wrong: illness has nothing venerable. Best regards, Hilmar Schmundt (feedback & suggestions?)

Siamese fighting fish are known for their aggressive behavior, they attack each other bitterly if they want to defend their territory. But what is going on in the brain of the magnificent animals? For an hour, a team led by the Japanese biologist Norihiro Okada released the fighting fish and found that the longer the fight, the more the genetic expression patterns in the brains of the opponents were similar. Those who fight with each other become more and more like their opponents, it seems. This brain physiological finding seems to confirm a presumption that the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche already indicated with a dark murmur: \"Whoever fights with monsters may see that he does not become a monster in the process.\" Anyway. The researchers next want to test whether advertising between males and females also leads to molecular harmonization. 5.63 A Twitter luck scale called \"Hedonometer\" has now dropped to this record low. The corona-related low in moods at the short message service has been going on since March, longer than ever before.

            " BMW employees should be given significantly more freedom in working hours in the future. Works council chief Manfred Schoch demands this. On at least two days a week, employees should no longer have to appear in the office, but should be allowed to work at home or at another location of their choice. \"That would be a wake-up call for the entire German economy,\" Schoch told SPIEGEL. \"Companies have to recognize that they should no longer bind their employees to a fixed location.\" A higher degree of flexibility would benefit not only the employees and their families, but also the environment. If all employers cut the duty to attendance to three days a week, commuter traffic would decrease by 40 percent, according to Schoch. \"With this simple measure, CO2 emissions and traffic jams could be reduced - and the quality of life in cities could be significantly increased.\" In turn, companies could save money because they would need less office space. Schoch, however, doubts that the turnaround will soon be implemented across Germany: \"There are still too many control fanatics on the management floors who prefer to have their employees right in front of their own office door.\" BMW management is also too dependent on a presence culture. \"We should use the crisis to make this new form of mobile work the social standard.\" Always on vacation Because of regular operations: Why the school chaos continues The BMW works council head had already proposed unusual measures in the past to reduce traffic and emissions. In autumn 2018, Schoch started a program for company bikes at BMW. He called on employees at the headquarters in Munich to switch to the more environmentally friendly and space-saving mode of transport. \"We have 40,000 employees in Munich,\" Schoch told SPIEGEL at the time, \"if only ten percent of them switched to bikes, two parking garages could be closed.\" Meanwhile, BMW claims to be one of the largest bicycle leasing companies in Germany.\n",

            " You can have whatever you want with the Dax. But at least it has not normally been expected that one of the companies listed in this index suddenly registers for bankruptcy. These 30 largest publicly financed corporations usually have enough money, after all, that's the joke. And yet it has happened this way: Wirecard, which has been listed in the Dax since 2018, has filed for bankruptcy proceedings, as the Munich District Court confirmed in the evening. In the light of the events of the past weeks: at least no big surprise. Almost two billion euros are missing, which should have been parked in the Philippines - around a quarter of the group's total assets. There is even a lack of certainty that money has ever existed. The long-time CEO Markus Braun is now also missing. A vital credit line, which has just been extended for a short time, may soon be missing. And there is a lack of confidence that this could somehow turn out well. This is an unprecedented disaster for the German financial world, the pace of development is breathtaking. After all, you already know this from Wirecard - the history of the group, which is not even 20 years old, was rapid even before this scandal. Wirecard's rise came when the New Market collapsed. As a reminder: The stock market euphoria was rampant in Germany in the 1990s. In the newly created Neuer Markt stock exchange segment, mainly technology companies were listed, some of whose shares recorded cartoon-like earnings growth. The ideas of the founders and CEO were traded, but there was often no added value behind them. The terrorist attacks of September 11th were followed by an economic crisis in which such technology companies shut down in rows. Wirecard, at that time still a software license dealer, was also in crisis at that time. A hired management consultant is supposed to clean up, Markus Braun. And he does, the management is so impressed that he will soon be employed as chief technology officer. With different interpretations of this salvation circulating. To this day, some in the company hold it up to him that he sold the old core business to the competition and hollowed out Wirecard. He denies that. What is indisputable: That he was appointed to the top position in 2002; that the new payment processing business gives the store a new perspective that many contemporaries don't even understand; that he knows how to interpret the vacancies left by failed Neue Markt companies as an opportunity. Back then, digital payment processing was something that many say: you have banks for that, what's the point? And the service includes three things: Not only the correct billing of sums of money for dealers and customers, but also that Wirecard assesses the risk of a failure to pay and steps in in an emergency. Ultimately, payment processors compensate for the inadequacy of banks, which often do not credit payments in real time: otherwise, the merchant only knows afterwards that everything works, the payment processor guarantees him immediate security. Wirecard's first customers include porn and gambling providers on the Internet. That too contributed to a semi-silky image in the early years. These industries are often simply those that translate technical progress into business particularly quickly. Today, for example, porn sites are among the pioneers when it comes to virtual reality. Braun appears as chief visionary, he builds the digital infrastructure from scratch as an IT specialist, he creates the important deals, together with his confidant Jan Marsalek. Braun quickly becomes the undisputed head of the company, controls centrally with only a small group of close employees. To the very end, its board has consisted of only four people - including Braun. Today Wirecard provides its services on every corner. A purchase from Aldi, paid by credit card - a card payment from Rossmann - a souvenir from Munich Airport. Other important customers are Apple, Google, Alibaba. And Wirecard is no longer the only payment provider. However, the brand has so far been little known to the public because, unlike PayPal, for example, it rarely appears to the end customer. Between these beginnings and the sudden (provisional) end there are only 18 years, eventful years. From 2007 at the latest, Braun internationalized the group and founded its own company for the Asian market. 2014 will be followed by Australia, South Africa and Turkey. North America in 2016, Wirecard acquires Citigroup's prepaid card division. In 2019 the group will buy in China. All of this always inspires the imagination of investors, they expect great things from Wirecard. From 2006, the company will be listed in the Tec-Dax for technology companies; in September 2018, Wirecard is finally so large that the group is promoted to the Dax. In return, Commerzbank flies out - and many observers see it as a symbol that the new financial world is replacing the old one. To the very end, there are believers in the stock exchange community who can imagine a price of 200 euros per Wirecard share. This Thursday he drops temporarily to 2.45 euros. There have been warnings for a long time: A lot of new business at Wirecard comes from markets with little transparency in payment processing. The emerging countries in particular were tackled in Asia and Romania in Europe. The willingness of many investors to feel euphoric did not slow it down. Even when the \"Financial Times\" (\"FT\") detonated the bomb in January 2019, which is now being torn apart by Wirecard, many investors still cling to the group. The allegations have been explosive from the very beginning: Whistleblowers from Singapore had contacted \"FT\" editor Dan McCrum in the autumn before: At their company, bogus sales were accounted for. In Germany, many initially brush that aside. Although the authorities in Singapore prove incorrect bookings, Wirecard only grants a volume of EUR 2.5 million, allegedly by mistake. Braun sued the \"FT\", attacks McCrum: He would personally benefit from the allegations - each of his articles leads to price losses. Even the German banking regulator Bafin is finally investigating in this direction. The \"FT\" rejects all allegations, a counterclaim is pending. In fact, there are always short sellers who bet on the further crash and thus profit from the crisis. It is not illegal. For the time being, there is a statement against a statement, but the Bafin no longer excludes that there could have been market manipulation by Wirecard. Fans hold Wirecard up for a long time, but it can't go on like this. Braun initiates a special test. After Wirecard's financial statements had been checked by EY (formerly Ernst & Young) for years, the competitor KPMG should now take a closer look at the 2019 figures. Meanwhile, bad signs are multiplying. Wirecard plans to issue a bond to raise 500 million euros for its further expansion. But two of the companies that are listed there as collateral do not have audited accounts. That means: The auditors do not want to stand for their numbers. Wirecard points out that this was not legally required at the location of the companies, Dubai. But that's not how you promote trust. The KPMG report will finally be available in April 2020. Shortly before, Braun rejoices that the paper will acquit his company. But it turns out differently. KPMG does not find any evidence of a targeted balance sheet fraud. But the insights that auditors provide are terrifying. There is insufficient evidence for payments to escrow accounts that are involved in this case, the control mechanisms at Wirecard are of little use, there is simply no interest in real clarification. However, the annual financial statements should be presented on June 18. But nothing comes of it. The EY auditors missed 1.9 billion euros, which should have been in those escrow accounts. They are intended as a cash reserve for failed payment transactions. EY refuses Wirecard's certificate - the prerequisite for completing the rules in accordance with the rules and for continuing an important credit line of over two billion euros. Now the shreds fly. The stock market price collapses. Jan Marsalek, Braun's confidant and one of the four board members, is released from his duties. Shortly thereafter, Braun himself announced his immediate resignation. The alleged partner banks of Wirecard, with which the trust accounts are to exist, report independently of one another: \"Wirecard is not a customer of ours.\" Did the accounts never exist? One of the two banks describes the documents that are intended to prove the existence of the account as a forgery. The line of credit granted by Wirecard's creditors to the company is in serious danger and will be extended again in the short term. EY is now assuming \"extensive fraud\". But none of it helps: This Thursday, interim CEO James Freis must file for bankruptcy proceedings to be opened. It will be exciting to see what remains of Wirecard when the smoke clears.\n",

            " The major Lufthansa shareholder Heinz Hermann Thiele wants to approve the rescue package for the battered airline. This is what Thiele told the \"Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung\". Nothing would stand in the way of the state's entry into the airline. \"I will vote for the resolution,\" Thiele told the newspaper. He voted against bankruptcy because: \"It is in the interest of all Lufthansa employees that management can conduct swift negotiations with the unions about the necessary restructuring.\" At the extraordinary general meeting on Thursday, the shareholders will decide on a federal capital participation and thus also on the associated rescue package of nine billion euros. The billionaire and industrialist Thiele could block state entry with his shares of 15.52 percent. The reason for this is the already established low participation of less than 38 percent of the voting rights, which gives Thiele a blocking minority on this fateful day for Lufthansa. In the event of failure, Lufthansa has announced to the shareholders that it will apply for a protective shield procedure as quickly as possible, which is a variant of an insolvency procedure. Previously, Thiele had surprisingly increased its stake and called for new negotiations on the state bailout package for Lufthansa. Among other things, he criticized that the federal government, in its role as a shareholder, could make job cuts more difficult. The corporation, which was hit hard by the corona crisis, put the global headcount at 22,000 jobs due to the permanently lower demand. Around 11,000 of these are in Germany. Measures are now to be agreed in the negotiations to keep as many employees as possible on board. These include, for example, extended part-time models and the waiver of salary increases and allowances.\n",

            " Hats are trendy. Aluminum hats above all. Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier even explicitly warned that they are not an effective substitute for a face mask. At least not in relation to viruses. The aluminum hat stands as a symbol for conspiracy theories, contemporaries with particularly contaminated ideas are often called aluminum hat wearers. This is actually irritating, because an aluminum cover is used for insulation and shielding - and was originally supposed to protect the wearer. How did this revaluation come about? And why was it still chic at the beginning of the 1950s to wear an antenna on your hat so that you could be received almost everywhere and at all times? One of the earliest aluminum hat references is found in a book by John Palfrey. The British wrote in 1909 of an \"insulating electrical device\" that \"surrounds the head while thinking\". The purpose is to \"keep thoughts and ideas\" and to protect against \"telepathic impact\" - that is, the unwanted intrusion of others' thoughts.

            " A little over a year ago, turmoil in the Rheinbad in Düsseldorf, in which chairs flew into the water and employees were attacked, caused a sensation nationwide. The prosecutor has now brought charges against a young person for threats. When the bathroom was cleared for the third time, the then 16-year-old is said to have told a staff member of the bathroom that he would smack her on the wall if he met her privately. Afterwards, he is alleged to have threatened the woman with killing her. The trial under juvenile justice is scheduled to begin on September 16 at the Düsseldorf district court. According to the public prosecutor, a second trial against a then 27-year-old was legally terminated with a penalty order. The man has to pay 30 daily rates of 20 euros - 600 euros. He had insulted a policewoman the third time the bathroom was cleared. The Rheinbad was cleared on June 29, 30 and July 26, 2019 with the help of the police. The charges against the then 16-year-old and the then 27-year-old on July 26 were the only crimes committed by the police during the turmoil. About the first incident, a report from the city administration later said that there was initially a dispute between young people and a family that had been surrounded and attacked by young people. The staff called the police for help. Later about 300 to 400 people attacked employees, threw chairs into the water and stormed the diving platform. The circumstances, especially of the last eviction, had sparked a political debate in which, among other things, the alleged origin of the people involved played a role. In addition, the Rheinbad responded with an identity card and wristband requirement in order to have a better overview of the bathers.\n",

            " The most controversial point of the EU copyright reform last year was Article 13, which ultimately became Article 17: the regulation that opponents viewed as mandatory to introduce upload filters on online platforms, although the term does not appear in it. The fear of faulty filter systems, which would not even leave important parts of online culture on platforms such as YouTube or Facebook, drove tens of thousands in Germany to the streets. The federal government also had concerns about the directive on this point, but ultimately agreed. The Federal Ministry of Justice (BMJV) has published a first draft discussion under Ministerim Christine Lambrecht (SPD) on how Article 17 could be implemented in national law by the coming year. The draft does not fundamentally exclude upload filters, but should help to avoid collateral damage. The most important points from the point of view of the users: The BMJV wants to grant them an express right to use copyrighted content for caricatures, parodies and pastiches. So far, something like that is missing in German copyright law. According to the draft, the platforms must offer a \"pre-flagging\" before each upload: If you want to upload something, you can indicate that he or she is referring to a permitted use, such as parodies or quotations. Content labeled in this way must not block platforms in advance. Exception: If the file is more than 90 percent a work reported by the rights holder, this should be viewed as an obviously illegal upload and prevented. Which is clear at this point at the latest: The design would not fundamentally prevent upload filters. The use of protected content is permitted for non-commercial purposes if it does not exceed 20 seconds (film or soundtrack) or 1000 characters (text) or 250 kilobytes of data volume (photo or graphic). This means trivial barriers. For this, however, the platforms have to pay a flat-rate remuneration to the rights holders. The most important points from the point of view of the authors: According to the draft, you receive a claim for remuneration against the platforms if licensed and thus copyright-legal content is uploaded there. You can get money directly from the platforms for the use of their work through the collecting societies. The catch: If you are not a member of a collecting society, you cannot assert your claims. This is not without problems for photographers. They should also be involved in the license payments under the minor barrier mentioned. The most important points from the perspective of rights holders: The BMJV is of the opinion that rights holders will in future be in a stronger negotiating position with the platforms than before. Because the platforms, that is the essence of Article 17, will in future be responsible for the content on their pages under copyright law - they can therefore be made liable. The 90 percent rule mentioned should reliably ensure that complete films or songs for which the uploader has no rights cannot be uploaded. This protects the business model of exclusive marketing via services such as Netflix or Spotify. The most important points from the point of view of the platforms: The draft contains a definition of platforms that are considered to be start-ups or small providers and are exempt from the liability regulation. Start-ups are companies that have been offering their services in the EU for less than three years and generate less than EUR 10 million in annual sales in the EU. Providers with an annual turnover of less than one million euros in the EU are considered \"small\". In addition, the draft is intended to give them legal certainty when it comes to the types of license offers that rights holders have to accept. In addition, the draft provides for various complaint procedures, for users, rights holders and also for the platforms. The Ministry of Justice wants to offer advantages to everyone involved, but also wants something for everyone. Former MEP Julia Reda from the Society for Freedom Rights also only partially positively evaluates the draft: \"After all, the proposal by Federal Minister of Justice Lambrecht shows that she has dealt with the vocal criticism of science, companies and users of Article 17\" , she writes to SPIEGEL. \"For the first time, it is making concrete suggestions as to how the Federal Government wants to prevent the blocking of legal content.\" It was also to be welcomed that \"the proposal provides for new copyright exemptions and would thus legalize large parts of everyday culture online for the first time\". The 90 percent rule, however, considers it unsuitable: \"Even if an upload completely matches the reported content, it is not automatically 'obviously illegal content'.\" Blocking decisions should therefore \"always be made by people\", otherwise \"far-reaching encroachments on fundamental rights\" cannot be prevented. All in all, Reda is clear: \"The Federal Government is breaking its promise to forego upload filters when implementing the EU copyright reform.\" If the proposal becomes law, she will \"carefully examine whether we will take legal action against it\". By the end of July, the BMJV wants to collect statements from \"interested parties\" and publish them on its website. Then the draft should go to the departmental vote. The directive must be implemented by June 2021. It is not the first draft to implement the EU directive. It was announced on Tuesday that the Federal Ministry of Economics and the Chancellery strictly rejected the BMJV's previous proposals: the two CDU-led houses did not want to support the wording on the ancillary copyright law or the suggested minimum participation for authors in income from it or from the collecting societies' income.\n",

The actor and cabaret artist has now told how the celebration in Passau, Lower Bavaria, went. \"I always knew that I wanted to marry Simone. But the corona crisis made this sign of solidarity particularly important to us,\" Fischer told the \"Bild\" newspaper. Accordingly, the two gave the yes in a very small frame. The civil wedding took place last Friday. The couple had announced the wedding in late January. The topic was a little \"threatening\" in the room, said Fischer at the time. The 66-year-old and his partner have been together for 13 years and live in Passau. According to the report, 15 relatives and friends attended the small celebration. The corona regulations would have accompanied the day. \"Of course, during the entire day, even at our private party, we carefully looked after the corona protection of ourselves and our guests,\" said the actor. \"In order to avoid misunderstandings, however, we took off the mouthguard when I said yes\" The cabaret artist, who suffered from Parkinson's, also dedicated his 49-year-old girlfriend to his autobiographical volume of stories published last autumn. The couple moved from Munich to Passau in 2017, where they inherited their grandparents' house. Brandlmeier made this move and a \"decent life, away from the sanatoriums, in a real home\" possible. Fischer is famous for appearances in the Sat.1 crime series \"Der Bulle von Tölz\", in the ARD crime series \"Pfarrer Braun\" or as Sir Quickly in the TV cult series \"Irgendwie und anyway\", which was launched in 1986 on Bavarian Radio . Fischer made his Parkinson's disease public several years ago and was combative.\n",

            " In normal times, the Council of Experts likes to take on the role of a reminder to assess overall economic developments. In the past, the so-called economic practices often warned that the federal government should not exaggerate the expenditure. The current head of the committee, Lars Feld, is one of the pioneers of the so-called debt brake. But times are anything but normal. On Tuesday, the economies presented a new economic forecast, according to which German economic output will shrink by 6.5 percent in the current year. This is even more pessimistic than a forecast made by the panel in March in a special report. The country is experiencing \"probably the greatest decline in economic activity since the existence of the Federal Republic\". In this situation, even a debtor pleads like a field for spending money. \"In the situation that is now facing economic policy, we are challenged to pursue an expansionary fiscal policy,\" he said. It would be \"very problematic from a fiscal point of view\" to think about consolidation in the coming year. Several council members agreed to the field, including the new Veronika Grimm economy: one should not talk about additional burdens at present, but must create a growth climate. With their statements, the economic modes support the course of the federal government. It is fighting the consequences of the corona crisis with multi-billion dollar immediate, credit and economic stimulus programs and is thereby significantly expanding government debt. The debt brake has been suspended, which is expressly permitted in times of crisis, but causes discomfort in parts of the CDU and CSU. Union leader Ralph Brinkhaus and Bavaria's Prime Minister Markus Söder called for an upper limit for government debt to be introduced. Feld indirectly rejected this initiative. He was \"careful about such limits\". The economy is currently advocating spending in the hope of a comparatively rapid recovery in the German economy. Accordingly, the economic trend is likely to resemble a \"pronounced V\" - a steep fall is followed by a similarly rapid recovery. The economy is expected to grow by 4.9 percent again next year. Before that, however, the low point initially calculated was \"expected to fall below\". One of the reasons for the greater pessimism among economists is that the restrictions on public life lasted significantly longer than initially thought. The situation in foreign trade would have \"deteriorated significantly\", said Feld. The USA, which is badly affected by the pandemic, is predicted to plunge by six percent, and in France, Italy and Spain the drop is likely to be between eleven and twelve percent. Against this background, the situation in Germany is \"somewhat bearable\". According to the experts, the recently put together economic stimulus package should also contribute to a comparatively mild course. According to the field, the economic methods assume a \"favorable effect\" without precisely quantifying it. The most expensive item in the package, the temporary reduction in value-added tax, is likely to be passed on to consumers only a good 50 percent. Even if the rest of the concession sacked the companies, this strengthens their solvency and thus \"remains an economic stimulus\". Feld and his colleague Volker Wieland were disappointed with the so-called loss recovery for companies, which in their opinion could have been more generous. At the same time, the economic stimulus package also \"luckily avoided some things\", said Wieland - for example a scrappage bonus, against which the economic practices had spoken out against. Wieland also warned in the direction of the SPD and opposition that it would be \"fatal\" if a discussion about tax increases or a wealth tax should start now. \"It would be a blow to the recovery we are now hoping for.\" The Frankfurt economist also praised the fact that the debt brake had \"worked excellently\" in the run-up to the corona crisis. At this point, Achim Truger, who sits on the committee at the suggestion of the unions, felt compelled to contradict. Truger recalled that, together with the former economist Isabel Schnabel, he already criticized the debt brake as an obstacle to investment in the last annual report and called for reform. In the current situation, however, there is a unanimous opinion on the subject of saving: \"Consolidation will come when the time has come.\"\n",

Duflo: We saw in this crisis how important the state is. In recent decades, people's trust in numerous institutions has slowly eroded, including in the state. But the market cannot regulate many things. This also includes the creation of a health system in which all people are covered by health insurance. SPIEGEL: However, the successes of the states in combating the crisis are very different. Duflo: In the past, many countries did not want to increase taxes or widen their budget deficit. As a result, important tasks have been neglected. This includes having sufficient capacity in hospitals for emergencies. Germany had enough ventilators and other medical equipment when the pandemic broke out. The death toll is much lower than in Italy, for example.

What the CDU politician Philipp Amthor did as a lobbyist for Augustus Intelligence was \"somewhere between mouse gray, stone gray, ash gray and lead gray\". In his text, Lobo also raised the question of what Augustus Intelligence should or should be. His answer: a German Palantir. The U.S. model was boosted with CIA venture capital and today sells analytical and surveillance equipment to the military and to intelligence agencies and law enforcement officers. According to the \"Handelsblatt\", Augustus Intelligence is not selling anything yet. But the communication and the connections to former intelligence officers such as ex-BND chief August Hanning and ex-constitutional protection president Hans-Georg Maassen recognize \"the role model and vision of the company,\" Lobo writes.

            " The university town of Princeton is located in the US state of New Jersey, which is particularly badly affected by the coronavirus. The Nobel Laureate in Economics, Angus Deaton, 74, and his wife Anne Case, 61, have therefore locked themselves in their house, both of whom belong to the risk group. The couple published the book \"Deaths of Despair and the Future of Capitalism\" in the spring. It traces the crash of the white working class in the United States, whose income has not increased for decades. Part of the blame for the decline is both attributed to the desolate US healthcare system. SPIEGEL: Ms. Case, Mr. Deaton, the whole world is wondering why the United States is suffering so badly from the corona pandemic. Do you have an explanation? Deaton: We are not epidemiologists. But the pandemic proves once again that the US healthcare system is a swamp. That was the case before, but now it shows how big the problems really are. More than 30 million people lost their jobs in the wake of the crisis - often with their health insurance.

This behavior is particularly important now that everyone is working to reverse the discrimination against past generations that have plagued the country's system and community. Timberlake wrote that the first lessons for children would take place at home and he was grateful to his family for having received these lessons. His parents would have listened to him when he had something to say that they didn't know yet. \"I pray for this humility with my own son.\" He was also grateful to his wife, who had made him a father. And also his son - from whom he also learns a lot. Justin Timberlake Finally, Timberlake made an appeal to all fathers.

            " Federal Interior Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU) described the riots in Stuttgart as an \"alarm signal for the rule of law\". He expected the judiciary to pronounce a \"hard punishment\" on the perpetrators involved, Seehofer told journalists in the capital of Baden-Württemberg. \"Punishments are always the best means of prevention to avoid this in the future.\" It must be made clear that the majority of the population are behind the police. That was important for the officials. It is about the \"credibility of the rule of law\". After the events, \"it should not remain with indignation,\" said the minister. The events in Stuttgart would also have to be embedded in the development in the Federal Republic as a whole, said Seehofer. For some time now, violence against the police and rescue workers has been \"increasing\". Apparently there are people who \"are not representative\" and see the officials as \"enemies\". Hundreds of people had rioted and attacked police officers in Stuttgart on Sunday night. The forces were thrown at them with bottles and stones, and a number of businesses were looted. At least 19 police officers were injured and 24 suspects were temporarily arrested. Baden-Württemberg's Interior Minister Thomas Strobl (CDU) spoke at the joint press conference with Seehofer about a \"challenge for the rule of law\". Security concepts will be developed with the city of Stuttgart. Perpetrators should now be consistently identified and prosecuted. There will be \"no legal spaces\" in Baden-Württemberg. Not only the police are responsible for this, but society as well. Specifically, he named the city administration and seller of alcoholic beverages. \"The social climate has to change,\" said Strobl. \"Our police officers did not deserve contempt and hatred and violence, but our respect, appreciation and thanks.\" He criticized that officials were suspected of being general. In an interview with the \"Bild\" newspaper, Strobl had previously said that there was \"up to now no evidence that this was a politically motivated action\". Nobody has anything against partying as long as it happens within the law. But there would be no open drug scene in the Stuttgart Palace Park. \"We will not become Görlitzer Park,\" said Strobl of a Berlin park known as a place for selling drugs. Liberality has limits, \"these limits are exceeded when violence is used\".\n",

            " Mel Gibson's reputation has suffered massively in recent years. The director has already admitted to insulting and beating his daughter's mother. He described a journalist as an \"asshole\" and once showered a police officer with an anti-Semitic hatred. Now the 64-year-old is once again confronted with allegations of anti-Semitism - and defends himself: statements made by his colleague Winona Ryder about alleged statements to her would have no basis. \"This is 100 percent not true,\" said a spokesman for Gibson in a statement. The 48-year-old lied in interviews ten years ago and now she would lie again. Ryder, known for example from \"Stranger Things\", had spoken in an interview with the British \"Sunday Times\" about an alleged incident in the 1990s at a party in Hollywood. Gibson made anti-Semitic and homophobic comments to her and a friend. In 2010 Ryder had similar comments about Gibson in \"GQ\" magazine. Gibson, best known for films like \"Mad Max\", \"Lethal Weapon\" or \"Braveheart\", had made the headlines more often during his career, including anti-Semitic mobbing, alcohol excesses and arguments with partners. In 2006, he became abusive to the police in California after being arrested for drunk driving. Some of his ranting, including anti-Semitic statements, came to light. Jewish groups criticized the actor, Gibson later apologized. The professing Catholic and director of the crucifixion film \"The Passion of Christ\" stated at the time that he had been fighting alcohol addiction for decades. He deeply regretted his relapse and the \"contemptuous\" comments when he was arrested.\n",

            " Minister of Labor Hubertus Heil wants to take action against the grievances in the meat industry with a ban on work contracts from January 1 at the latest - the Federal Cabinet has long agreed on this. Clemens Tönnies fought for a long time against the abolition of this form of employment and warned against \"structurally negative changes for the agricultural economy\". In view of the massive corona outbreak in his company, he has now announced an end to this form of work - which he would have to do anyway. Germany's largest slaughterhouse therefore wants to end all work contracts \"in all core areas of meat production\" by the end of 2020 and hire the employees in the Tönnies group of companies. This was announced by Tönnies in Rheda-Wiedenbrück. The Tönnies competitor Westfleisch had announced that by the end of the year they would even hire all of the employees themselves and waive contractors. According to the announcement, Tönnies wants to take further steps to improve the situation of its workers. For example, digital time recording should be introduced at all German locations for workers. The North Rhine-Westphalian Minister of Health Karl-Josef Laumann had criticized the lack of digital time recording. \"The Tönnies can tell you which pig the Mettwurst is made of - but he can't do digital time recording,\" said the CDU politician in the ARD talk \"Hart but fair\". This can cause problems if it is necessary to understand who has worked when and where to fight the pandemic. Digital time recording also makes abuse of overtime more difficult. In addition, the company claims to create sufficient and adequate living space for the employees of the group at the locations. This point should also be implemented by January 1, 2021 if possible. According to a Tönnies spokesman, there could be a time problem in the remaining six months until the end of 2020. Public pressure on tonnies is growing. More than 1500 of its employees have already tested positive for the corona virus. The state of North Rhine-Westphalia imposed a lockdown for the entire district of Gütersloh with around 370,000 inhabitants. Public life will be shut down from Wednesday until June 30th. The state police send several hundreds to quarantine thousands of people. Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) accused Tönnies of unwillingness to cooperate. The authorities should have enforced the disclosure of worker data. \"There was no more cooperation, there was decree.\" Co-owner Clemens Tönnies seems to be gradually realizing that his previous business model could be a problem in the future. \"We want to continue producing meat in Germany in the future. To do this, we need social acceptance,\" says the entrepreneur, who is also chairman of the supervisory board of Bundesliga club FC Schalke 04. \"This applies to all chains of meat production and explicitly includes agriculture.\" For Tönnies, however, its operation is not the only problem: It could also be tight at Schalke. The head of the supervisory board has moved into the crosshairs of the fans. The Ultras give the entrepreneur a complicity in the crisis. \"Schalke is not a slaughterhouse! Against the disassembly of our club,\" is the motto of several fan organizations that have announced a demonstration for Saturday. At 3.30 p.m., when the Bundesliga team starts their last game of the season at SC Freiburg, the fans want to form a human chain around the club premises - in compliance with the hygiene regulations. Clemens Tönnies will not be able to see it personally. He is in quarantine in his company after the Corona outbreak.\n",

Low tide and strong gusts of wind had led to the emergency and made the rescue operation more difficult. Volunteers from RNLI, a British sea rescue organization, attached a tow rope to detach the 7-meter sailboat from the ferry. There were two people on board the sailor.

However, Pink and Hart initially did not divorce and in 2009 they found each other again. This year they have been married for 14 years. Pink had already announced last year that couple therapy had an important part in the success of their relationship. Now she has spoken to her therapist Vanessa Inn about it for the first time.

            " She was very concerned about \"telling people that Carey and I were in couple counseling with Vanessa,\" said Pink. But: \"That is the only reason why we are still together.\" As a spouse, you simply speak \"two different languages,\" says Pink. Her therapist had translated for her in the past 18 years, Pink continued. As a child, you wouldn't be taught how to cultivate relationships. \"What is happening in our country is a perfect example of this,\" the singer apparently said, alluding to the clashes between anti-racism protesters and police officers. \"We don't know how to love each other, we don't know how to get along, we don't know how to communicate.\" The singer also spoke about how much she had to work to get close to and open to other people. \"Intimacy is the part that I find difficult,\" she said. There was a moment in the couple counseling that she will never forget, says Pink. She kept complaining about her husband there about the fact that he \"is simply not present, that he is not here, that he does not understand it, that he does not hear me emotionally, that he does not even try to understand my language \", she said. At such a moment, therapist Inn said: \"Okay, shut up, stand up, put your hands on the other's heart and just look into your eyes.\" Pink went on to say, \"His hand was on my heart and his eyes were looking into my soul, and now guess what I did? I started to giggle and looked away.\" At that moment, she recognized her own problems. In January, Pink had written a declaration of love on Instagram for her husband's 14th wedding anniversary. \"It is not perfect, but I am grateful that it is ours,\" she wrote. Hart also remembered their wedding day with a wedding photo of the couple. \"I am so proud of the life we ​​have built together,\" wrote the motocross rider. They both came from broken families, but they had been working steadily on their relationship. \"And look at us now! We were two outsiders when we met, we grew up together and now have a great family.\"\n",

            " The relaxation of the initially strict Corona rules are still young, but again people have to fear for their vacation. So far, the regional lockdown only applies to the Gütersloh and Warendorf districts, but other regions are also close to reaching the critical limit of 50 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants within seven days. If it is exceeded, the security measures against further virus spread are increased. In the meantime, several federal states have set up rules for travelers from circles with an increased infection rate. Accommodation bans apply in Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria and Lower Saxony. In Schleswig-Holstein, travelers from affected regions have to be in quarantine for two weeks, and holidaymakers from high-risk areas are also prohibited from entering Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania; holidaymakers from Gütersloh have even been asked to leave in some regions. There are only exceptions if the affected holidaymakers can submit a negative corona test that is not older than 48 hours. But even a negative test is not a free ticket. There are several test methods that can detect either acute or surviving infection with the Sars-CoV-2 coronavirus. The now mandatory 48-hour rule applies primarily to PCR tests that can indicate whether someone is infected at the time of sampling. In the process, the genetic makeup of the virus is found in the laboratory. However, even a negative result does not completely rule out infection: the virus can only be detected at a certain point in time with a throat or nose swab. If someone has just been infected, the viruses may not have reproduced enough to be displayed. According to a study in the journal \"Annals of Internal Medicine\", PCR tests do not work reliably if there are no symptoms. On the first day after the suspected infection, the tests were negative in 100 percent of the cases examined, although the patients were proven to be infected. Accordingly, the optimal time for sampling is on the eighth day after the infection. On average, the chance of getting a false negative was greater than one in five. It is also known that the pathogen load in the throat decreases as the infection progresses. In these cases too, a test may give a false negative result. This means that the affected person is not infected according to the test result, even though he carries the virus. Correct sampling is also crucial. For the most reliable result, a smear must be taken deep from the throat or nose, the procedure is correspondingly unpleasant. Because the test is only a snapshot, the Robert Koch Institute recommends a second PCR test for typical symptoms in order to rule out infection as far as possible. \"If people want to go on vacation and need such a test, you have to be aware of this,\" says Susanne Pfefferle from the University Hospital Eppendorf, \"They must therefore also comply with all applicable protective and safety measures. And the following also applies: If someone has contact with a confirmed infected person, he or she must continue to be in quarantine and not travel. \" The evaluation of the test is comparatively fast, ideally a laboratory only needs a few hours. However, sampling, sending it to the laboratory, communicating the results and traveling to the holiday destination are also recorded in the time account. Affected people should speak to the doctor beforehand until when a result can be expected. On Thursday morning, long lines formed in front of the test centers in the Gütersloh and Warendorf districts. The test capacities were partially exhausted on Wednesday and are now to be expanded. In the Gütersloh and Warendorf districts, all people can be tested for corona infection free of charge. A voluntary mass test is to show whether the virus has spread beyond the Tönnies meat factory. According to the first results, only one out of 2,000 tests was positive. So far, the health insurance company has usually only covered the cost of a test if there is a valid reason. Assumption of costs for a vacation trip should not be included. This means that holidaymakers who have already traveled from risk areas in Western Pomerania-Greifswald can be tested at their own expense. The price is around 150 euros. Conclusion: A PCR test is only a snapshot and cannot always detect an infection with the Sars-CoV-2 coronavirus. However, outbreaks can be prevented if a test before an upcoming vacation turns out to be surprisingly positive and the infection would otherwise have remained undetected. Infected people are likely to be contagious before they get symptoms themselves. Even those who are completely unaware of the infection can apparently pass the virus on.\n",

They hold hands and smile at the camera: Crown Princess Victoria and Prince Daniel celebrated their tenth wedding anniversary in Sweden - and on this occasion published a new photo of themselves. Fittingly, the anniversary for the crown princess couple this year was midsummer evening, which the Swedes traditionally celebrate extensively. Because of the corona virus pandemic and the associated meeting restrictions and distance requirements, larger celebrations are not possible on this midsummer weekend. Victoria and Daniel also wanted to spend their special day privately - how exactly, that was not communicated in advance. Victoria had married the former middle-class Daniel Westling on June 19, 2010 in the Stockholm Cathedral. Millions of people worldwide had watched the wedding on television, with an estimated 500,000 people lining the streets of Stockholm to celebrate with the couple.

            " The map of \"Fortnite: Battle Royale\" is constantly changing thanks to ongoing updates: Currently, a large part of the game world is flooded. But in the \"Fortnite\" universe there are also recurring elements, such as vehicles that stand around somewhere. With these vehicles, however, players of the online title have noticed something these days: since the last major update, there are no police cars anymore. According to user reports, the cars are also missing in the creative mode of \"Fortnite\", in which fans can build their own maps. What is behind it is unclear. Manufacturer Epic Games has so far not commented on the topic publicly. A SPIEGEL request from Monday morning has also remained unanswered. However, it seems obvious that Epic Games removed the cars in response to the major protests against racism and police violence, particularly in the United States. \"I would not say that it is a political statement,\" the Wall Street Journal quotes an anonymous source on this theory, which is said to be close to the development of \"Fortnite\". \"I think we are just sensitive to the issues that a lot of people in our audience deal with.\" According to the source, vehicles continue to exist in the game world after the update, but actually no police vehicles. With regard to the insider quote, it seems possible that Epic Games no longer, or at least for the time being, no longer wanted to expect players affected by police violence to encounter police symbols in the fantasy world of their favorite game. It could also be a goal of the manufacturer to avoid that police car scenes from \"Fortnite\" become part of the political scene. In the case of \"Fortnite\", for example, videos in which players position themselves around a car and chant protest slogans via the voice chat would be conceivable. In the past few months, for example, the Nintendo Switch game \"Animal Crossing: New Horizons\" has been used for digital protests against the Chinese government, and the Hong Kong protests have also been echoed in \"Grand Theft Auto Online\". \"Fortnite\" is one of the most popular video games at all, it can be played on PC, on consoles, but also on smartphones. In May, Epic Games announced that 350 million users had already registered for the free game with optional additional purchases. The police cars in \"Fortnite\" were always just an ornament - they stood around in the area, but characters could not drive with them. With an upcoming update of the game, however, there will soon be several controllable cars, it suggests advertising material from Epic Games. Epic Games promotional image: Soon there will be mobile cars in \"Fortnite: Battle Royale\" A Reddit user commented that he believed that Epic Games had removed the police car against this background: he thinks the manufacturer has avoided the controversy that it could mean if \"Fortnite\" players from police cars could shoot at other players. He doesn't know whether this function was ever really planned. Hardly any player doubts that the disappearance of the cars is a reaction to the political situation. Another Reddit user speaks of \"sad times\": \"The anti-cop mood achieves everything.\" Yet another user criticizes removing the cars ruining some of the cards he built himself: \"It just feels so stupid that police cars are removed from a video game - just because of the problems that exist in America.\" Some social media users see a \"Fortnite\" without a police car presence but also as progress: \"I can't stand the glorification of the police in video games and that makes me genuinely happy,\" commented a Twitter user who says she is 11 years old Son played \"Fortnite\" and told her about the change.\n",

            " The high temperatures were already announced last week - with the start of the new week, many places in Germany are now starting into sunny days. According to the German Weather Service (DWD), the reason for this is Atlantic gravure systems, which will bring warm air masses from the subtropics in the coming days. \"Accordingly, the daily highs continue to rise in the course of the week and already reach the 30-degree mark in the west on Wednesday,\" said a DWD meteorologist in Offenbach. On Thursday, the thermometer can even show 32 degrees locally in the west and southwest. The sun shines almost everywhere in the country. Only in the far east and southeast there are dense clouds. You can bring single showers and short thunderstorms. How long the summer weather lasts over Germany is not yet entirely certain. By the weekend, low air pressure is already causing strong thunderstorms, especially in the southwest of the country - as a result of which the temperatures will drop somewhat.\n",

            " After the Corona outbreak at the meat company Tönnies, the federal government is increasing the pressure on the industry. \"We want to further tighten controls even before the new occupational safety law in the meat industry is in place,\" Federal Minister of Labor Hubertus Heil (SPD) told the newspapers of the editorial network in Germany. Federal Minister of Economics Peter Altmaier (CDU) called on Deutschlandfunk to \"hold those responsible to account\". At the same time, the coalition fractions want to start a far-reaching restructuring of livestock farming. The conditions in the German meat industry have been criticized for years. In mid-May, the federal cabinet decided on new requirements. Among other things, there is a ban on contracts for work, which is to apply from January 1, 2021. \"We are working with several ministries to make the ban legally secure,\" Heil told the RND newspapers. The draft law should be available in summer. Regarding the incidents at Tönnies in the district of Gütersloh, where more than 1,000 employees have so far been tested positive for the coronavirus, Heil told the \"Tagesspiegel am Sonntag\" that the employees were \"deliberately exposed to a significant health risk in the pandemic\". \"We will no longer accept this form of ruthless business.\" Federal Minister of Economics Altmaier said in the \"Interview of the Week\" of Deutschlandfunk, which is to be broadcast on Sunday, that he wants \"that the trust in food and meat 'Made in Germany' is maintained\". That means \"that we also ensure that those responsible are held accountable and that the grievances are remedied by making appropriate changes.\" The coalition fractions are also focusing on livestock farming. The draft for a joint application states that the recommendations of the Competence Network Farm Animal Husbandry are \"to be followed up consistently and in full\". Among other things, the committee headed by former Federal Minister of Agriculture Jochen Borchert (CDU) proposed better housing conditions in February. An additional tax should be levied on their financing. 40 cents per kilogram of meat and meat products, two cents per kilogram of milk and fresh milk products as well as eggs and 15 cents per kilogram of cheese, butter and milk powder were proposed. Now the coalition groups are standing behind the ideas of the commission. \"The lobby and influential agricultural politicians have rejected any standard improvement for far too long,\" said SPD parliamentary deputy Matthias Miersch of the AFP news agency. \"We finally need clear criteria for the stable of the future that take animal welfare and climate protection into account and give farmers planning security.\" Most recently, Federal Minister of Agriculture Julia Klöckner spoke out in favor of an animal welfare fee. According to AFP information, the proposal should be discussed in the plenary session of the Bundestag in the last week of the session before the summer break. The \"Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung\" first reported on the paper. FDP faction deputy Michael Theurer criticized the plans for new taxes. \"Higher food costs are particularly detrimental to families and people with low incomes and are therefore socially unfair,\" he said. The Catholic Church also reacted to the Corona outbreaks and denounces \"exploitation and slavery-like practices\" in several meat factories. Migrants from Eastern Europe would be \"abused in the middle of Germany as cheap labor and housed in inhumane dwellings,\" said Auxiliary Bishop Ansgar Puff (Cologne), Chairman of the Migration Commission of the German Bishops' Conference and chair of the Human Trafficking Working Group. \"The exploitative employment in the meat industry is a scandal.\" There have always been voices pointing to the disastrous conditions, and there have also been reactions from the legislature. \"But overall, you have to admit: Before the Corona cases in the slaughterhouses, hardly anyone was interested in the subject. It was simply too easy for many to close their eyes.\" That is why there has been a lack of social will to effectively break through a \"exploitation-based business model\". Lazy tricks for circumventing the minimum wage, inadequate occupational safety measures and overcrowded accommodation must now be politically blocked. Everyone has to be asked whether what he consumes is the result of exploitation, said the Auxiliary Bishop. \"We have to be aware that our consumer behavior influences working conditions and wages.\"\n",

            " So far, tens of thousands of students have applied for emergency aid because of the corona crisis. According to the German Student Union on Thursday, 58,000 applications have been received so far. If everyone were approved, the total would be 24.5 million euros. A total of EUR 100 million in bridging aid is available from the federal government for the months of June, July and August. \"We do not expect the application process to proceed in a progressive, linear manner,\" said Achim Meyer auf der Heyde, General Secretary of the German Student Union. \"With the easing of the corona pandemic measures initiated, students may be able to find classic summer semester part-time jobs when the economy starts up again.\" According to the German Student Union, a total of 2.7 million women and men are enrolled at universities, who in theory would be entitled to state emergency aid. Depending on the account balance, students can receive between 100 and 500 euros per month. They don't have to pay back the money. The application must be made every month, the aid is paid for a maximum of three months. The Education and Science union had called for the aid fund to increase tenfold over the weekend. Leftists and Greens also warned that the money might not be enough. \"It is currently not really possible to say whether the sum of 100 million euros is too little or too much,\" emphasized Meyer auf der Heyde of the German Student Union. It is not known how many students are in an acute financial emergency. Many students had lost their jobs in the corona crisis, for example because bars and restaurants were closed. \"But some of them found jobs again.\" The German Student Union also assumes that students in the pandemic will receive more support from their families, says Meyer auf der Heyde. \"And some have probably moved back to their parents to save rent.\"\n",

            " The monument measures more than two kilometers in diameter: archaeologists came across several deep pits near Stonehenge, which were probably excavated more than 4,500 years ago and once formed a circle around a stone age cult site. The discovery was made without excavations, a peculiarity. Hardly any other archaeological site in the world has been researched as well as Stonehenge and it is now clear that the stone circle was not lonely in the landscape. The entire region around today's Stonehenge was obviously of outstanding importance for the people of the Stone and Bronze Age. They came here for centuries and erected huge monuments - some are even older and larger than Stonehenge. Because these were often not built from stone, but from wood and earth, they have not been preserved so well and are often hardly recognizable today. To track down these hidden monuments, archaeologists have been using area radar and magnetometers for years. This makes anomalies in the ground visible - without excavation. A team of researchers from the University of Birmingham, the University of Bradford and the University of Vienna discovered more than 200,000 mines near Stonehenge between 2010 and 2016 alone. Not every one of the pits is an archaeological sensation, many arise, for example, when a tree and its roots fall over. The researchers also initially considered the huge soil anomalies discovered to be natural leaching. But then they noticed a peculiarity: 20 of the pits formed an almost perfectly shaped circle - with a gigantic diameter of about two kilometers. The researchers are certain that the plant must originally have consisted of significantly more pits. Construction measures, especially in modern times, have very probably destroyed them. Some of the huge circular pits were 20 meters wide and at least five meters deep. \"I cannot stress enough how difficult it must be to dig these shafts with tools made of stone, wood and bone,\" says archaeologist Vincent Gaffney, who led the research project. The researchers cannot say whether something was in the pits or the facilities were places for sacrifices. However, drilling shows that they weren't just dug out to bury something inside. Apparently the mines themselves had a meaning, it took centuries for them to fill up again. Some can still be recognized as sinks to this day. At the bottom of one of the pits, archaeologists found remains of bones that must have come from around the time when the system was built. Because ancient carbon is stored in the bones, the researchers can determine their age. The method, also known as radiocarbon dating, measures the amount of C14 in the sample. Every living being absorbs this carbon isotope via the air and food as long as it lives. As soon as it dies, the supply of C14 stops - from then on the radiocarbon clock runs. The carbon isotope decays with a half-life of almost 6000 years. This allows researchers to determine the approximate age of the sample. According to analyzes, the pit must have been excavated at the end of the Neolithic period around 4,500 years ago. The other pits were probably created at the same time. Around the time when the famous stone circle was built by Stonehenge. The researchers suspect that the mine could have been a kind of gateway to a sacred area - but not to Stonehenge, which is three kilometers southwest. Right in the center of the mining district is a much larger and probably older monument than Stonehenge: the Super Henge by Durrington Walls.

            " Henges are typical monuments of the Neolithic and early Bronze Age. They consist of an earth wall and an inner trench, which form a circle. Most of the time, the systems can only be entered via four opposite entrances. It is not clear what these monuments were used for. They could have been places for ceremonies or huge observatories. Many of the facilities are designed according to special cosmological features such as the summer or winter solstice. At 500 meters in diameter, Durrington Walls is the largest fully preserved henge in the UK. Outside the earth wall, archaeologists found the remains of a settlement with references to hundreds of houses. Since some house walls are buried under the earth wall, at least part of the settlement must be older than Durrington Walls. This suggests that the region was populated thousands of years ago and probably already played a national role at that time. Another monument, the \"Larkhill Causewayed Enclosure\", can be found exactly on the line of the now discovered circle of huge pits, which is probably 1500 years older than Durrington Walls. \"The area around Stonehenge is one of the most researched archaeological sites on earth,\" says archaeologist Gaffney. \"It is noteworthy that the use of new technologies can still lead to the discovery of such a massive prehistoric structure that is significantly larger than any comparable prehistoric monument that we know of, at least in Britain.\"\n",

            " The federal and state governments have promised the schools in the digital pact 5.5 billion euros, 500 million of which can also be spent on end devices under the impression of the corona crisis. They should then go on loan to needy students. If you believe the McKinsey management consultants, these 500 million do not even cover ten percent of the device costs. On Friday, the consultants published a study on what they believe to be the steps that have to be taken in schools after the corona crisis. \"Their digitization, which is inadequate in many places, is now becoming more apparent than ever before,\" write the consultants with reference to the schools and their more or less successful attempts to organize learning at a distance. Although 80 percent of schools had provided digital learning opportunities for almost all of their classes, \"this offer often consisted of teachers sending e-mail or mail\". Real digital learning offers were used far too little. In a European comparison, the degree of digitization of the German educational landscape is the lowest. The crisis could now trigger the digital breakthrough in the classrooms. The McKinsey advisors recommend a three-stage action plan for this: In the short term, the aim is to enable all students to learn from home. All children and young people and all teachers would have to be equipped with personal tablets or laptops, software and Internet access. The consultants estimate that the devices will be purchased for six billion euros - \"costs that we believe are definitely worth investing in the education of our children\". According to the study, the school must become the main learning location \"if possible\". In the medium term, however, all those involved should adjust to teaching formats that combine face-to-face and distance learning, the authors write: Children and teachers from risk groups \"must have the opportunity to receive or give almost equivalent classes at home\". Teaching digital and technological skills should become the long-term goal of teaching. \"For this purpose, classrooms and specialist rooms have to be equipped with projectors, Internet-compatible computers and WLAN,\" the consultants write - and they give teachers hope: In the future, thanks to the new technologies, they could use their working hours more efficiently, McKinsey promises. By automating certain work steps, teachers can save 20 to 40 percent of their time. It is clear that the schools cannot develop and implement the necessary digitization strategies alone, the study says. Long-term support from the federal and state governments is needed, particularly in the financing of hardware and software, but also in the training of teachers. On the other hand, however, colleges should not sit back and wait for educational aid programs: \"Motivated school management and teaching staff who familiarize themselves with the subject without hesitation are key drivers of success.\" A recent survey by the GEW education union showed that teachers have a strong motivation for digital teaching: According to this, 93 percent of teachers use digital media. Nevertheless, they are highly dissatisfied: just 29 percent said they had sufficient technical equipment for presentations at school. The teachers complained in particular about the lack of equipment, the lack of technical support from the employer and an inadequate range of further training.\n",

            " A knife attacker killed at least three people in the British city of Reading. Three other police officers, Ian Hunter, said they had suffered serious injuries. The investigators were not currently assuming a terrorist background. Since the motive has not yet been determined, the officials will be supported by colleagues from the anti-terrorist units. The deed was committed in a city park about 65 kilometers west of London. Several people enjoyed a warm summer evening at Forbury Gardens. A witness told the PA news agency: \"The park was pretty full, lots of people were sitting around drinking with friends when a single person went through and shouted some unintelligible words.\" The man was suddenly heading for a group of eight or ten friends, a witness told the BBC. Then he stabbed. He \"caught the first three pretty badly\". They are said to have been stabbed in the neck and upper body. The man is said to have run to another group and attacked people there as well. Videos on Twitter show paramedics treating bleeding people lying on the floor. The authenticity of the recordings could not initially be confirmed independently. A 25-year-old from Reading was arrested at the crime scene on suspicion of murder, the police say, and he is in custody. There are no other suspects. Prime Minister Boris Johnson spoke of a \"horrific incident\". Interior Minister Priti Patel said she was \"deeply concerned\". She spoke of a \"senseless attack against people who just wanted to enjoy a Saturday evening with families and friends\". The police are investigating the incident. Shortly before, there had been a peaceful demonstration of the Black Lives Matter movement nearby. However, the police categorically ruled out a connection. In a statement, the investigators point out: \"The whole thing happened three hours after the rally ended.\"\n",

            " The corona virus has done a lot of harm. But environmentalists say that the pandemic is a blessing for the climate. Since the epidemic moves around the world, less has been produced and consumed worldwide, less flown and more work done at home. The International Energy Agency estimates that CO2 emissions will decrease by eight percent this year - the largest decline in history. So should the \"Fridays for Future\" movement choose the pathogen as their heraldic animal? Better not, as the researchers from the Berlin Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change (MCC) show in a new study. The corona crisis consumes less energy all over the world. But at the same time, many governments are now more concerned about the economy than the global climate, so that the pandemic could help the most dangerous of all environmental killers to make an undesirable comeback: coal power. China, the largest emitter of CO2 in the world, approved almost as many fossil fuels in the first quarter of this year as in the entire previous year. And in other emerging countries, climate-damaging power plants are becoming more attractive during the crisis. \"The danger is great,\" says MCC director Ottmar Edenhofer, \"that many governments are going back to coal to revive the economy.\" Special reports, analyzes and backgrounds on topics that affect our society - from reporters from all over the world.

Don't miss anything: Subscribe to our Coronavirus newsletter for the latest developments and key background information. 11.30 p.m .: Before the start of the summer vacation in North Rhine-Westphalia, Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) warned against disadvantaging holidaymakers from the Gütersloh district. \"The message to everyone who is now looking at Gütersloh: Almost no cases are known outside of the meat industry,\" said the CDU politician on Tuesday evening in the ARD \"Tagesthemen\" with a view to other federal states. \"I only warn against stigmatizing the residents of this circle now.\" On Tuesday it became apparent that the outbreak in North Rhine-Westphalia would have an impact on many people's vacation planning. On Monday, 14 people from Corona hotspots were asked to leave prematurely on Usedom. Restrictions will also apply to travelers from Corona hotspots in Bavaria and Schleswig-Holstein. 10:35 p.m .: Austria apparently wants to let a limited number of spectators back into the stadiums from August 1st. From August 1st, up to 1250 fans per game should be allowed. From September 1st, the maximum capacity is to be increased to 5000 to 10,000 fans per game. Vice Chancellor and Minister of Sport Werner Kogler told the \"Kleine Zeitung\". The games in Austria are currently taking place without spectators due to the corona virus pandemic. Accordingly, there should be a general upper limit for events, with a distinction also made between open-air and indoor events. The infrastructure of the stadiums is also decisive for the permissible maximum limit. The exact rules should be announced in June, according to Kogler. 10:00 p.m .: Israel has declared several places to be a restricted area due to an increased number of infections with the corona virus. Both the central city of El'ad and individual residential quarters of the northern city of Tiberias are to have restricted access for seven days from this Wednesday, the committee responsible decided on Tuesday. The decision follows a recommendation from the Ministry of Health. It was only on Sunday that the country's hospitals reopened their corona wards due to the increasing number of infections. Restrictions on other locations would be considered, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said. According to the Ministry of Health, 21,247 people in Israel were demonstrably infected with the corona virus by Tuesday evening. 15,860 of these have recovered. According to the ministry, 308 people have died as a result of Covid 19 disease. 7:25 pm: The leading US immunologist in the corona crisis, Anthony Fauci, has expressed concern about the significantly increasing number of cases of coronavirus infections in several US states. Fauci spoke at a hearing in the House of Representatives of an \"alarming increase in infections\" in Florida, Texas, Arizona and other states. The next few weeks would be crucial to counteract this surge, Fauci said. But there are also successes in the fight against the virus in the USA. In New York State, for example, the number of cases has been reduced. Around half of the 50 U.S. states have an increase in corona infections. Fauci said the tremendous effort to find a vaccine is progressing. He remains confident that an effective vaccine will be available early next year. But there is no guarantee. Fauci disagreed with Donald Trump's statement that the US president had instructed the authorities to conduct fewer tests. Trump claimed this at an election campaign weekend, after which the White House spoke of a \"joke\". However, the President said on Tuesday when asked a reporter that he was not kidding: here you will find external content from Twitter that complements the article. You can show it with a click and hide it again.\n",

            " Fauci, however, said in the House of Representatives: \"We will test more.\" Other members of the Corona Task Force also said there was no instruction to reset the tests. The US was hit hard by the pandemic, Fauci emphasized. They are the country with the most identified coronavirus infections worldwide. More than 2.3 million cases have been recorded since the pandemic started, with around 27 million tests conducted. More than 120,000 people died after being infected with the Sars-CoV-2 pathogen. 6.46 p.m .: At the French soccer champions Paris St. Germain, three players and one employee were now infected with the corona virus. The club headed by trainer Thomas Tuchel announced on Tuesday that the screening tests before the resumption of training \"showed four previous cases of contamination with SARS-CoV-2\". However, the people are no longer contagious and can therefore regularly take part in the training. The club left open who exactly it is. On Monday, PSG started to test all professionals medically and healthily in preparation for the final tournament of the Champions League in Lisbon from August 12th. The training of the national players Julian Draxler and Thilo Kehrer should start in small groups on Thursday. Only striker Edison Cavani (Uruguay), who migrated to Inter Milan, and right-back Thomas Meunier (Belgium), who is associated with a move to Borussia Dortmund, were not among them. Brazilian superstar Neymar, on the other hand, is happy to \"get started again. I can't wait to get back on the pitch and make history.\" In contrast to the other top European leagues, Ligue 1 had already broken off its championship in March due to the corona pandemic and declared Paris the champions. The last game before the Corona compulsory break won PSG 2-0 against Borussia Dortmund and thus secured the entry into the quarter-finals of the premier class. 6.44 p.m .: Finland wants to lift the travel restrictions imposed by the corona crisis in mid-July for a number of European countries, including Germany. The possibility of entry then depends on the infection in the respective country, Interior Minister Maria Ohisalo and Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto announced at a press conference. As of July 13, travel from countries that have recorded fewer than eight new corona cases per 100,000 inhabitants within a two-week period should be possible again. As of today, nine countries in the EU and Schengen area, including Germany, Austria and Switzerland, fell - Finland, however, Finland's most important neighboring country, did not. Finland had already lifted its borders for travelers from the Baltic States, Norway, Denmark and Iceland in mid-June. 6:27 p.m .: The one-week lockdown imposed on the Gütersloh district because of the massive corona outbreak at the meat company Tönnies is too short from the perspective of the virologist Alexander Kekulé. It usually takes two weeks for symptoms to appear in all infected, said Kekulé in a podcast from \"MDR Aktuell\". In the worst case, the restrictions would be lifted again on June 30, and only then would it become clear how many people had actually been infected. He does not assume \"that the lockdown can be ended after a week,\" Kekulé emphasized, also with regard to the time that the authorities needed for tests and evaluations. \"That is why I would have announced two weeks in advance,\" said the chair holder at the Martin Luther University in Halle-Wittenberg. Kekulé also accused the authorities in North Rhine-Westphalia of not responding quickly enough after the new infection site became known. A district should not be cordoned off \"with announcement,\" said the virologist. \"If you say that beforehand, a lot of people are out of the region.\" It is to be feared that \"really many employees left Gütersloh and the factory prematurely and have now spread the virus somewhere in the republic or to neighboring cities\". North Rhine-Westphalia's Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) announced in the morning the reintroduction of the strict contact restrictions and closings of restaurants as well as cultural and sports facilities in the district of Gütersloh. The restrictions should apply until June 30th. The background to this is the massive corona outbreak at the Tönnies meat group in Rheda-Wiedenbrück. There, more than 1,550 employees tested positive for the corona virus. 6.15 p.m .: Travelers from corona risk areas such as the district of Gütersloh in North Rhine-Westphalia will have to be quarantined in Schleswig-Holstein in the future. They should move into their apartment or other suitable accommodation immediately after entering the country in order to isolate themselves there for 14 days, as the state government announced. However, one is aiming for a nationwide approach - there will be a telephone conference of the health ministers on Wednesday. The limit is more than 50 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants in the past seven days in an area. The state government reacted to the massive new infections in the Gütersloh district in a large meat company. From when exactly the quarantine regulation will apply, it did not initially announce. Campsites, youth hostels and all other facilities with sanitary community facilities that would have to be used by those affected are considered unsuitable quarantine accommodations. The regulation is due to be adopted on Wednesday. The number of new corona infections in Schleswig-Holstein is at a low level. 5:58 p.m .: Corona infections also occur among employees in a slaughterhouse in Wildeshausen, Lower Saxony. As a spokesman for the district of Oldenburg announced, 23 of the 50 tests so far were positive in the course of a staff test. The corona tests of all 1,100 employees at the location of the PHW group of companies are to be continued on Wednesday. The PHW Group is one of the large meat groups and sells poultry products under the Wiesenhof brand name. In May, after the first major corona outbreaks in the industry, the government of Lower Saxony ordered compulsory series tests for all companies in the country. According to the district spokesman, additional measures should also be taken depending on the extent of the infection. 5:34 p.m .: Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced a tax increase for high incomes in the corona crisis. The Kremlin chief announced in a television speech that the tax on income of more than five million rubles (around EUR 64,260) would increase from 13 to 15 percent from January 1, 2021. The corona pandemic and low oil prices have exacerbated the economic crisis in Russia. Mass unemployment as a result of the corona crisis is also breaking income from income taxes into the household. To fill the state coffers, Russia also increased VAT from 18 to 20 percent in early 2019. That had led to massive criticism. Putin said that the additional income tax income would bring the budget about 60 billion rubles (770 million euros) a year. The money should primarily benefit children with serious illnesses. For July, Putin also promised families another special payment of 10,000 rubles (128 euros) per child. 17:28: Federal Foreign Minister Heiko Maas (SPD) during a visit to Valencia appealed to German vacationers in Spain to adhere to the local Corona protective measures. After the opening of the Spanish borders, German tourists would have to show \"reason and responsibility\" to prevent the number of infections from rising again, said Maas after a meeting with his Spanish colleague Arancha González Laya. Foreign Minister Heiko Maas with his Spanish colleague Arancha González Laya. Spain is one of the countries most affected by the coronavirus pandemic in Europe. Almost 250,000 people in the country have been infected with the novel corona virus, and more than 28,000 have died. The decision by the Federal Foreign Office to lift the travel warning for the country before the start of the summer vacation was made after close coordination with the Spanish government, said Maas. After months of strict exit restrictions in the country, it was now important that both the foreign tourists and the Spanish hosts were protected from a new outbreak of Corona. However, the authorities should be prepared for \"that there are further infections,\" the minister emphasized. In an emergency, it cannot be ruled out that \"the travel advice will turn into travel warnings\". 17:16: Corona infections have been detected in 44 residents of a building complex in the Berlin district of Friedrichshain. Due to \"some\" corona cases, the health department there carried out extensive tests on contact persons last week, a spokeswoman for the district informed the dpa news agency on request. The households concerned were therefore placed in quarantine. The people would have had no symptoms. Children were also among the infected, it said. Schools, daycare centers and youth leisure facilities were informed immediately. The district office provides people in quarantine with food and hygiene items. It was not initially known whether there is a connection to the current corona outbreak in Berlin-Neukölln with almost 100 confirmed cases. Around 370 households are quarantined at seven locations - cross-connections to other districts were also suspected. 5:04 pm: The Kremlin praises its fight against the corona virus as particularly successful. Russia actually has a better death rate than Italy, for example - but official statistics raise questions. Read on here. 4:40 p.m .: The virologist Christian Drosten fears that the virus will spread unnoticed in North Rhine-Westphalia after the corona outbreaks, among others. Preventing spreading beyond the area is now the key, the Charité scientist said in the NDR podcast. In general, there are currently clear signs in several places, including Berlin, that Sars-CoV-2 is coming again. From the virologist's point of view, great caution should be taken that no second wave is developing. He referred to the situation in the southern United States, where a \"terrible situation\" is developing despite the high ambient temperatures. There was loosened too early. \"I am not optimistic that in a month we will still have the peaceful situation we have now in terms of epidemic activity,\" said Drosten. \"In two months, I think we'll have a problem if we don't turn on all the alarm sensors again now.\" The population must understand that the health authorities need support and consensus. 16:22: The Central Council of German Sinti and Roma has warned against blaming the minority for Corona outbreaks. \"If you make Corona a pandemic, the spread of which is specifically attributed to Roma, it will produce social explosives,\" said Romani Rose, chairman of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. Among other things, Roma are particularly affected by the outbreaks in the meat industry. \"We know that there are a large number of Roma from all countries in Southeast Europe who live and work in the meat industry, but also in agriculture in Germany as seasonal workers or as temporary workers under sometimes inhumane conditions,\" Rose told the newspaper. Responsible for the conditions are companies that act out of \"blank profit interest\". 4.15 p.m .: Due to the corona pandemic, the entire fleet of the Lufthansa subsidiary SunExpress was already on the ground. The holiday airline is now being discontinued. 15:56: Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has to wear a mouth and nose mask in public after a court order. If Bolsonaro does not adhere to this, he has to pay a penalty of the equivalent of around 340 euros (2000 reais) per day, federal judge Renato Borelli orders. The far right Bolsonaro had long denied the danger of the virus and spoke of a \"small flu\". Bolsonaro had attended events in the capital without a protective mask. In Brazil there are now more than one million cases of infection known, the second highest number in the world after the United States. Around 50,000 people have died from an infection. 15:56: After the Corona outbreak at the meat processor Tönnies, the authorities impose a lockdown for the neighboring district of Warendorf. Just like in the Gütersloh district, there are contact restrictions, indoor sports and numerous cultural events are prohibited, said NRW Minister of Health Karl-Josef Laumann (CDU). Schools and daycare centers in the district would also be closed from Thursday. Read here what the lockdown in the Gütersloh district means politically and practically. 3:39 pm: Almost all infected employees at Tönnies work in meat cutting, where slaughtered animals are cut up in chords. It is cool, noisy there - apparently the ideal place for the spread of the corona virus. 15:34: Europol has warned of the radicalization of individual offenders through strict corona measures. The risk of terrorist attacks is increasing, according to the latest police report on terrorism, which was presented in The Hague. The possible economic and social consequences of the pandemic could fuel the radicalization, writes Europol leader Catherine De Bolle in the foreword to the report: \"Activists from the left as well as right-wing extremists and from circles of jihadist terrorism are trying to exploit the pandemic to further their goals to propagate. \" 3:12 p.m .: Due to the high level of unemployment in the USA as a result of the coronavirus crisis, green card work permits will no longer be issued by the end of the year. At the direction of US President Donald Trump, the two-month immigration ban has not only been extended, but also extended to a number of work visas, a government official said on Monday. Among other things, this applies to the so-called H-1B visa, from which the technology sector in particular benefits. The industry responded with harsh criticism. The United States issues H-1B visas annually to 85,000 skilled workers, many of whom work in the technology sector. The president's new order also affects most student and academic J visas, as well as L visas that companies use to bring overseas workers to the United States. 2:59 p.m .: The National Women's Soccer League wants to return on Saturday as the first major North American league. But Orlando Pride around superstar Marta has to fit - there were too many corona cases. Six players and four employees tested positive for the virus. A big setback. 2:54 p.m .: Corona-related contact closures are to be further relaxed in Saxony-Anhalt. From the beginning of July, the only recommendation should be to meet no more than ten people and have as few changing contacts as possible, said Social Minister Petra Grimm-Benne (SPD) in Magdeburg. No fines should be imposed. 14:38: Despite criticism from independent scientists, pubs, restaurants, hotels and many other facilities in England are allowed to reopen from July 4th. Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced this in Parliament in London. At the same time, the distance rule will be reduced from two meters to one meter if other measures are taken to contain the coronavirus. Among other things, visitors must leave their contact details when entering. Cinemas, museums, libraries, hairdressing salons and places of worship may also reopen under certain conditions. The new regulation only applies to England. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland set their own measures. There was sharp criticism of the easing. The reduction of the minimum distance indoors to one meter would be equivalent to lifting the contact restrictions, according to a statement by the group of independent scientists \"Independent Sage\". The number of new infections per day is still too high at around 1,000. In addition, there must be a functioning system for tracking contacts. Johnson had announced that it would introduce a \"world-class system\" by early June. In the meantime, however, the government had to admit that this promise could not be kept. The UK is the most severely affected by the coronavirus pandemic in Europe. 2.30 p.m .: Novak Djokovic was criticized for his show tournament despite the corona crisis. He appeased himself. Now the tennis star has tested itself positive for the virus. 2:21 pm: Because of the corona pandemic, Saudi Arabia has drastically limited the number of pilgrims to the Muslim pilgrimage Hajj this year to a few thousand. \"It could be a thousand or fewer or a little more,\" said Saudi Hajj Minister Mohammed Salih Bintin in a virtual press conference. \"We don't expect tens of thousands and we don't expect hundreds of thousands.\" The number will depend on the requirements of health protection. Last year, more than two million Muslims took part in the pilgrimage to the city of Mecca, which is sacred to Muslims. Most of them came from abroad. Muslim pilgrims on the pilgrimage in Mecca This year the pilgrimage begins in late July. The Saudi government had already announced on Monday evening that only pilgrims who were already in the country were allowed to participate in this year's pilgrimage. Health Minister Taufik al-Rabia said that only pilgrims under the age of 65 were admitted. They would be tested in advance to ensure that they were not infected. After the hajj they would have to be in quarantine. Saudi Arabia has reported more than 160,000 Corona virus infections and more than 1,300 deaths. It is the Arab country with the most cases. 1:47 pm: The Berlin Senate has imposed a fine for those who refused to wear a mask. This applies to buses and trains in local public transport. At the same time, the red-red-green Senate is lifting the contact restrictions. From Saturday, several people can meet privately in the capital again. So far, a maximum of five people from several households or only members of two households may meet in public in the capital. In addition, more people will be allowed to stay in shops from Saturday. Until now, each customer of a store had to have 20 square meters as a guideline, the Senate has now reduced the required area to ten square meters. 1.35 p.m .: In view of the massive outbreak of corona in the district of Gütersloh, Bavaria prohibits the accommodation of people who want to enter the southern federal state from there and from other hard-hit counties. Hotels and pensions in Bavaria will no longer be able to accept guests who come from a district in which the number of new infections in the past seven days was more than 50 per 100,000 inhabitants. State Chancellor Florian Herrmann (CSU) said after a cabinet meeting in Munich. \"This is a protective measure that we think is really necessary,\" said Herrmann. The only exception is for people who have a current negative corona test. 1:26 pm: The R-value is well over 2, the infection numbers have increased: Lothar Wieler, head of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), attributes this to local outbreaks. And warns that Sars-CoV-2 is still a danger in Germany. 1:00 p.m .: The federal states are preparing for the fact that the corona pandemic will result in new school closings. This is one of several scenarios that are currently being worked on, said the President of the Conference of Ministers of Culture (KMK), Stefanie Hubig (SPD). Federal Education Minister Anja Karliczek (CDU) sees the education system better prepared for restrictions than in spring. Hubig and Karliczek commented on the presentation of this year's educational report, which also highlights the corona crisis. According to the KMK decision from last week, regular school operations throughout Germany should start again after the summer holidays at the latest. The Rhineland-Palatinate department head Hubig said on Tuesday that this is one of three scenarios for which preparations are now being made. The federal states also planned for a new \"rolling system\" with classroom and distance learning as well as for the \"complete closings\" of the schools. 12.50 p.m .: Around 10,000 and 12,000 coronavirus tests are to be carried out around the first two Formula 1 races in Spielberg, Austria in July. As the Austrian news agency APA reported, the concept provides that the samples are transported twice a day to an analysis laboratory in Ebersberg east of Munich. There they will be evaluated around the clock. The results should be known no later than one day after sampling. The samples are taken from the nose using a smear. The first two test stations at the Red Bull Ring were opened on Tuesday. Initially, there should only be ghost races, but even these are already a challenge: Around 3,000 employees worked on the ring and had to be checked regularly, according to those responsible. 12:20 p.m .: On Monday, on the holiday island of Usedom, 14 people from Corona risk areas were asked to leave prematurely. You must report to your local health department immediately, said Achim Froitzheim, spokesman for the Vorpommern-Greifswald district. The problem had become noticeable when paying the tourist tax. On Monday, a couple from Gütersloh were asked to leave the island early. In the district of Gütersloh in North Rhine-Westphalia, there was a massive corona outbreak in a meat factory of the Tönnies company. The spokesman initially did not say whether the returned holidaymakers are all from Gütersloh. Tourists on the island of Usedom According to Froitzheim, a high number of unreported cases can be assumed. The 14 cases only represented Monday. \"This topic affects the entire Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania holiday region. Of course, we are reluctant to send holidaymakers back, but it is our job to take action.\" Froitzheim referred to the applicable regulation of the State of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. Accordingly, people are not allowed to enter or stay if they come from a district or an independent city in which the number of new infections per 100,000 inhabitants has exceeded 50 in the past seven days before entry. According to the state regulation, guests from high-risk regions in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania can also go on vacation. To do this, they must provide a medical certificate that confirms \"that there is no evidence of an infection with the Sars-CoV-2 coronavirus.\" 11:57: Business trips again instead of video conference? According to a survey by the Ifo Institute, numerous companies will refrain from doing this even after the corona crisis. The industry in particular assumes significantly fewer trips. 11.45 a.m .: According to media reports, cinemas, museums and galleries may also reopen in England from July 4th. However, certain precautions in cultural institutions such as advance booking of tickets and visitor paths are only one-way, the newspaper \"The Guardian\" reported. Prime Minister Boris Johnson wanted to announce further easing of contact restrictions in England in the early afternoon. This should include a reduction in the previous minimum distance of two meters and the opening of restaurants, pubs and hotels. Each country in the UK sets its own measures to fight the corona virus. Critics, including doctors and unions, consider the easing to be premature. Great Britain is the worst affected country in Europe by the pandemic. 11.37 a.m .: More than 1500 employees of the Tönnies meat factory in North Rhine-Westphalia are infected with Covid-19. Now the district of Gütersloh is put under strict measures, said Prime Minister Armin Laschet. Cinemas and gyms close, and barbecuing outdoors is prohibited. 11:23: The World Trade Organization (WTO) looks a little more optimistically into the future in view of the first signs of economic recovery. The worst scenario in April, which saw world trade fall by 32 percent this year, has now become less likely to this extent, the WTO said in Geneva. The decline is still historical, \"but there is a silver lining: it could have been much worse,\" said WTO chief Roberto Azevedo. According to the current status, world trade would only have to grow by 2.5 percent per quarter in the rest of the year in order to limit the minus to the optimistic WTO scenario of 13 percent for the year as a whole. The signs of recovery included a significant increase in freight flights and handling in container ports in recent weeks. On the other hand, the outlook for 2021 has deteriorated somewhat, it said. The recovery may be less positive than initially thought due to a possible second corona wave or trade restrictions. It is more likely that global trade will grow by around five percent in 2021. However, the 20 percent forecast in April is still achievable. In general, given the dynamics of the corona crisis, the outlook is still associated with many uncertainties. 10:48: Family Minister Franziska Giffey (SPD) has rejected criticism of the federal government's corona policy with regard to families and children. \"We have focused on families from the start,\" said Giffey in an online discussion by the Berlin merchants and industrialists association. The closure of schools and daycare centers was considered and the variant \"in which not so many people die,\" the family minister emphasized. \"We always have to remember that. And there are families among them, and to say that they didn't matter, it's just not true.\" You shouldn't make the mistake of turning the economy against families, Giffey said. She referred to economic stimulus or short-time work benefits. These measures would benefit millions of mothers, fathers and families. \"The families are people who take part in economic life.\" 10.14 a.m .: After the corona outbreak at Tönnies in Rheda-Wiedenbrück, the specified threshold for new infections was also exceeded in the neighboring district of Warendorf. According to the Robert Koch Institute, 68.4 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants were recorded for the Warendorf district. 50 cases are considered the limit for additional protective measures. Warendorf district administrator Olaf Gericke (CDU) attributed the new infections on Monday afternoon to the Tönnies employees living in the district in 1243. You are under quarantine. A district lockdown was not necessary because the infections did not spread to the rest of the population, the district administrator had said. The district administrator had appealed to the citizens to \"continue to be careful and to comply with the known distance and hygiene rules\". In addition, free corona tests would also be made possible in the Warendorf district for everyone who lived in particularly affected places or who was understandably worried - for example because they had contact with Tönnies employees. Such tests are possible at central locations and the costs are borne by Tönnies. 9:57 am: The police union (GdP) complains of growing disrespect to the officials in the corona pandemic. The disrespect for the police and rescue workers has been going on for a few years, said deputy GdP chairman Jörg Radek in the ARD \"Morgenmagazin\": \"And now we are obviously experiencing through the pandemic, like a magnifying glass, that things are getting worse here. \" At the beginning of the pandemic, police measures had been accepted, but the longer the pandemic with its conditions continued, the less understanding there was. \"This also partly turns into aggression.\" The GdP would therefore like more support: \"Politicians should make police action more transparent.\" After the recent riots in Stuttgart there is clear support for the police. \"I would like to wish for that to remain sustainable,\" said Radek. 9:43 am: The bottom line is that people in Germany have hardly benefited from wage increases because of the corona crisis. Real wages rose in the first quarter by 0.4 percent compared to the same period last year, the Federal Statistical Office announced. This is the lowest increase since the end of 2013. Real wages had grown by an average of 1.2 percent throughout the past year. At the start of the year, wages rose overall, according to the Wiesbaden statisticians. From the second half of March, however, short-time working was widely reflected in the wallet of workers. In individual sectors such as gastronomy and the hotel industry, nominal wages already fell because the working hours of employees fell sharply. Real wages in Germany have increased by an average of one percent per year since 2007 - meaning that even after inflation has been deducted, people have more money in their pockets. 9:22 am: Vacationers can use the Corona warning app in the opinion of Chancellor Helge Braun even before the main travel time in some other EU countries. \"We think, for example, that we can connect Austria, Switzerland, and Italy even before the main summer season, because they have a very similar concept to ours,\" says Braun on Bayerischer Rundfunk. Schwieriger sei die Nutzung in Frankreich, weil dort ein zentraler Ansatz der Datenspeicherung und nicht ein dezentraler wie in Deutschland gewählt wurde. 08.55 Uhr: In Ostwestfalen droht nach dem Corona-Ausbruch beim Fleischfabrikant Tönnies ein regionaler Lockdown. Tausende sind in Quarantäne, der NRW-Gesundheitsminister Karl-Josef Laumann spricht über mögliche weitere Verschärfungen. 08.18 Uhr: Der Lufthansa-Konzern bietet wieder Linienflüge auf das chinesische Festland an. Wie die Fluggesellschaft mitteilte, soll es ab Mittwoch (24. Juni) jeweils einmal pro Woche eine Verbindung von Frankfurt nach Shanghai geben. Another flight is scheduled every Friday from Shanghai to Frankfurt. According to Lufthansa, these are the group's first regular flights to mainland China since the end of January. 07.55 Uhr: In Südafrika ist die Zahl der registrierten Coronavirus-Infektionen auf mehr als 100.000 gestiegen. The number is now 101,590, the Ministry of Health in Pretoria announced on Monday. Südafrika ist das Land mit der mit Abstand höchsten Zahl von offiziell erfassten Coronavirus-Fällen auf dem afrikanischen Kontinent. Die Zahl der registrierten Neuinfektionen in dem Land hatte zuletzt deutlich zugenommen. Nach Angaben der Weltgesundheitsorganisation (WHO) entfällt mehr als die Hälfte der in ganz Afrika erfassten Coronavirus-Infektionsfälle auf Südafrika. Die Zahl der offiziell verzeichneten Corona-Toten in dem Land lag am Montag bei 1991. Binnen 24 Stunden zählten die Behörden 61 weitere Todesfälle. 07.30 Uhr: Das Ende der Reisewarnung für viele Länder hat den Passagierverkehr am Frankfurter Flughafen vergangene Woche etwas belebt. Vom 15. bis 21. Juni zählte der Flughafenbetreiber Fraport an Deutschlands größtem Airport 161.482 Fluggäste und damit 89,4 Prozent weniger als ein Jahr zuvor. Das teilte der MDax-Konzern am Dienstag in Frankfurt mit. Das waren fast anderthalbmal so viele Fluggäste wie in der Vorwoche, als der Rückgang im Jahresvergleich 92,8 Prozent betragen hatte. 05.45 Uhr: Im März standen wegen der Corona-Pandemie Teile der Menschenwelt für ein paar Wochen still - und auch die Bewegungsmuster etwa von Rehen, Störchen und Enten haben sich offenbar geändert. There are at least initial indications of this, said the director of the Max Planck Institute for Behavioral Biology in Konstanz, Martin Wikelski. Er will nun gemeinsam mit einem internationalen Konsortium von Forschern untersuchen, wie sich der Lockdown auf die Tierwelt ausgewirkt hat. The scientists hope to gain insight into this from data from mini transmitters with which wild animals worldwide are equipped. The researchers plan to publish the first results of the study this autumn. Die Corona-bedingte Möglichkeit, solche Daten zu sammeln, sei einzigartig in der Geschichte der Menschheit und ein \"unfassbares wissenschaftliches Geschenk\". Wikelski und sein Team erhoffen sich durch das Forschungsprojekt Erkenntnisse für ein besseres Zusammenleben von Mensch und Tier. \"We may find that relatively minor changes in our lifestyle and infrastructure result in significant benefits for ecosystems and people,\" said the researcher. 05.15 Uhr: Die lokalen Behörden haben dem Robert Koch-Institut (RKI) 503 Corona-Infektionen binnen eines Tages gemeldet. Damit haben sich seit Beginn der Coronakrise 190.862 Menschen in Deutschland nachweislich mit Sars-CoV-2 angesteckt, wie das RKI am frühen Dienstagmorgen meldete (Datenstand 23.06., 0 Uhr). 8895 mit dem Virus infizierte Menschen starben nach RKI-Angaben in Deutschland - das bedeutet ein Plus von 10 im Vergleich zum Vortag. Etwa 175.700 Menschen haben die Infektion nach RKI-Schätzungen überstanden. That is 400 more than the day before. Die Reproduktionszahl, kurz R-Wert, lag nach RKI-Schätzungen mit Datenstand 22.6., 0.00 Uhr, bei 2,76 (Vortag: 2,88). This means that an infected person infects between two and three other people on average. The R value shows the infection process approximately one and a half weeks beforehand. Seit Mitte Mai gibt das RKI zudem ein sogenanntes Sieben-Tage-R an. It refers to a longer period and is therefore less subject to daily fluctuations. Nach RKI-Schätzungen sank dieser Wert mit Datenstand 22.6., 0.00 Uhr, auf 1,83 (Vortag: 2,03). It shows the infection from 8 to 16 days ago. Vor allem der Ausbruch bei Tönnies im Kreis Gütersloh sowie zwei weitere kleinere Hotspots hatten die Infektionszahlen ab Mitte Juni wieder steigen lassen. 04.00 Uhr: 60 Tage sollten die Visa-Beschränkungen in den USA dauern - doch nun will Donald Trump die Blockade deutlich verlängern. Betroffen sind auch hoch qualifizierte Fachleute. Die Kritik ist schon jetzt laut. Lesen Sie hier mehr dazu. 03.30 Uhr: Die nationale Gesundheitskommission in China meldet binnen 24 Stunden 22 neue bestätigte Infektionen mit dem Coronavirus, 13 davon in Peking. Tags zuvor waren auf dem chinesischen Festland 18 Fälle aufgetreten, darunter neun in der Hauptstadt. Die Stadt mit mehr als 20 Millionen Einwohnern meldete den ersten Fall einer neuen Virus-Welle am 11. Juni. Der Ausbruch wurde auf einen Großmarkt zurückgeführt, im Zuge dessen wurden Teile Pekings abgeriegelt. Bisher haben sich nach offiziellen Angaben 249 Menschen in der Stadt angesteckt. Die chinesische Gesundheitskommission meldet sieben weitere asymptomatische Fälle, die in China nicht zu den bestätigten Fällen zählen, da die Infizierten keinerlei Symptome zeigen. 03.01 Uhr: Mehr als eine Viertelmilliarde Kinder weltweit haben keinen Zugang zu Bildung - und die Coronakrise hat diese Lage noch verschärft: Zu diesem Schluss kommt die Unesco in ihrem aktuellen Weltbildungsbericht. Laut dem am Dienstag in Paris veröffentlichten Report leisteten 40 Prozent der ärmsten Länder während der Pandemie keine Unterstützung für mittellose oder besonders gefährdete Schüler. Insgesamt waren mehr als 90 Prozent aller Lernenden weltweit von Schulschließungen betroffen. Bereits vor der Pandemie sei die Ungleichheit massiv gewesen, heißt es in der Studie der Uno-Kulturorganisation. Die Untersuchung mit dem Titel \"Inklusion und Bildung\" basiert auf Daten aus dem Jahr 2018. Danach hatten fast 260 Millionen Kinder und Jugendliche in der Welt gar keinen Zugang zu Bildungsangeboten - das entspricht rund 17 Prozent aller Minderjährigen im Schulalter. Die Erfahrung lehre, dass \"Gesundheitskrisen viele Menschen zurücklassen können\", betonte Unesco-Generaldirektorin Audrey Azoulay. Dies gelte besonders für \"die ärmsten Mädchen, von denen viele vielleicht nie wieder in die Schule zurückkehren werden\". Die Uno hat sich zum Ziel gesetzt, bis zum Jahr 2030 jedem Jugendlichen die Möglichkeit eines mittleren Bildungsabschlusses zu garantieren. Am 31. Dezember wandte sich China erstmals an die Weltgesundheitsorganisation (WHO). In der Millionenstadt Wuhan häuften sich Fälle einer rätselhaften Lungenentzündung. Mittlerweile sind mehr als sieben Millionen Menschen weltweit nachweislich erkrankt, die Situation ändert sich von Tag zu Tag. Auf dieser Seite finden Sie einen Überblick über alle SPIEGEL-Artikel zum Thema. 02.18 Uhr: Brasilien verzeichnet nach Angaben des Gesundheitsministeriums binnen 24 Stunden 21.432 neue bestätigte Coronavirus-Fälle sowie 654 neue Todesfälle infolge der Krankheit. Seit Beginn der Pandemie sind in dem lateinamerikanischen Land 1,1 Millionen Infektionen registriert. Die Gesamtzahl der Todesfälle steigt offiziellen Daten zufolge um 654 auf 51.271. Weltweit vermelden nur die USA mehr Infektionen. Das Ausmaß der Krise könnte aber sehr wahrscheinlich viel größer sein, da das Land vergleichsweise wenig testet. Kritiker werfen dem rechtsextremen Staatschef Jair Bolsonaro vor, die Gefahren nach wie vor zu unterschätzen. 01.23 Uhr: Die Zahl der Arbeitslosen in Deutschland dürfte nach Einschätzung der Bundesagentur für Arbeit (BA) infolge der Coronakrise erstmals seit zehn Jahren im Sommer wieder über drei Millionen steigen. \"Wir werden im Sommer voraussichtlich die Drei-Millionen-Marke überschreiten\", sagte BA-Chef Detlef Scheele der \"Süddeutschen Zeitung\". Im saisonbedingt üblicherweise schwierigeren Arbeitsmarkt im Winter war die Arbeitslosigkeit zuletzt vor fünf Jahren so hoch. Scheele hofft aber, dass sich die Lage nach dem Sommer bessert. Damit die Arbeitslosenzahl im Herbst wieder sinke, müssten jetzt die Lockerungen der Corona-Beschränkungen in der Gastronomie oder Reisebranche wirken, der Welthandel in Gang kommen und das Konjunkturpaket der Bundesregierung \"zünden\". Besonders hart treffe die Coronakrise befristet Beschäftigte und Zeitarbeiter, sagte der BA-Chef. Youth unemployment is also increasing. Bei Frauen habe die Pandemie eine doppelte Negativwirkung. They are more active in particularly affected industries than men and thus earn less. Zugleich müssten sie mehr Betreuungsaufgaben übernehmen. \"Ich hoffe sehr, dass vier Monate Corona nicht alles zerstören, was in Jahrzehnten an Gleichberechtigung am Arbeitsmarkt erreicht wurde. Wir müssen alles daransetzen, dass dies nicht passiert\", sagte Scheele. 00.50 Uhr: Nach dem Auftritt von US-Präsident Donald Trump in Tulsa sind zwei Mitglieder seines Wahlkampfteams positiv auf das Coronavirus getestet worden. Beide hätten an der Veranstaltung teilgenommen, sagt ein Sprecher. Allerdings hätten sie während der ganzen Zeit Masken getragen. Stunden vor dem Auftritt Trumps hatte sein Team sechs positive Tests unter den Mitarbeitern bekannt gegeben. Sie hatten nicht an der Veranstaltung teilgenommen. Der Auftritt im US-Bundesstaat Oklahoma am Samstag war Trumps erster Auftritt vor Tausenden Anhängern seit Beginn der Coronakrise, allerdings kamen deutlich weniger Menschen als erwartet. Die Gesundheitsbehörden hatten im Vorfeld der Veranstaltung eine Vielzahl neuer Infektionen befürchtet. In den USA haben sich nach Angaben der Johns Hopkins University über 2,3 Millionen Menschen mit dem Coronavirus infiziert, über 120.000 sind in Zusammenhang mit dem Virus gestorben. Das Land hat weltweit mit Abstand die höchste Infiziertenzahl. 00.15 Uhr: Tennisfunktionär Dirk Hordorff wirft Mitorganisator Novak Djokovic vor, seine Vorbildfunktion während der umstrittenen Adria-Tour vernachlässigt zu haben. \"Wie soll ich einem Jugendlichen erklären, dass er Abstand halten und sich die Hände waschen soll, wenn Djokovic Ringelpiez mit Anfassen spielt? Das ist ein katastrophales Bild\", sagte Hordorff, Vizepräsident im Deutschen Tennis Bund (DTB), dem Sport-Informations-Dienst. Die von dem Weltranglistenersten Djokovic mitorganisierte Showtour hatte bereits zum Auftakt in Belgrad Kritik wegen mangelnder Hygieneregeln hervorgerufen. Einige Spieler um Djokovic irritierten zudem mit Partyvideos. Sowohl in Belgrad als auch im kroatischen Zadar waren Zuschauer zugelassen; Djokovic gab ohne Abstandsregeln Interviews: Auf der zweiten Station in Zadar wurden bis Montagabend nun mehrere positive Coronafälle im Teilnehmerfeld bekannt. \"Es geht nicht nur um die Spieler, es waren 100 Jugendliche in Kontakt mit ihnen\", sagte Hordorff. 00.01 Uhr: Die schwarz-rote Koalition sieht die dauerhafte Überwindung der Corona-Pandemie und die wirtschaftliche Erholung als zentrale Aufgaben der deutschen EU-Ratspräsidentschaft. Das geht aus einem Papier der Koalitionsspitzen nach einem Treffen am Montagabend im Kanzleramt hervor, das der Nachrichtenagentur dpa vorliegt. \"Mit der Covid-19-Pandemie steht die Europäische Union vor einer schicksalhaften Herausforderung\", heißt es in dem knappen Beschluss. Germany will, during its presidency, \"work with all its might to master this task together and in a future-oriented manner and to make Europe strong again\". \"Leitgedanken\" der deutschen Ratspräsidentschaft, die am 1. Juli beginnt, sollen demnach außerdem sein: \"ein stärkeres und innovativeres Europa, ein gerechtes Europa, ein nachhaltiges Europa, ein Europa der Sicherheit und der gemeinsamen Werte, ein starkes Europa in der Welt\". Was das jeweils konkret bedeuten soll, geht aus dem Papier nicht hervor.\n",

            " The management board of the payment service provider Wirecard, according to a message from Monday night, assumes that the bank balances on trust accounts totaling 1.9 billion euros \"do not exist with a high degree of probability\". The company had previously assumed the existence of these accounts and had shown them as an asset. At the same time, Wirecard withdrew the preliminary assessment of the 2019 financial year. \"Possible effects on the financial statements of previous financial years cannot be ruled out,\" the statement continues. The Philippine banks BDO Unibank and Bank of the Philippine Islands had already announced on Friday that the German Dax group was not a customer of theirs. Documents from external auditors that said the opposite were forged. The total should have been in the accounts of the two banks. Wirecard has so far been unable to prove the existence of the 1.9 billion euros. The money corresponds to around a quarter of the total assets of the Aschheim payment service provider. As the EY auditors (formerly Ernst & Young) subsequently refused to carry out the seal of approval for the annual financial statements, Wirecard banks could now refuse further funds. Then the lights could go out for the company - a case of historic proportions in economic history. The stock has suffered significant losses for days. There is also a huge crash internally. Jan Marsalek, one of the company's four board members, was initially released on Thursday. On Friday, the long-time CEO Markus Braun announced his immediate resignation. According to SPIEGEL information, Mark Tolentino, a lawyer with a law firm in the Philippine financial center Makati City, is the trustee of the 1.9 billion euros to which Wirecard is allegedly entitled and which the auditor EY has so far been looking for in vain. Tolentino is currently submerged. On his law firm's website, Tolentino is described as \"young, dynamic and aggressive\". He is available to his clients as an experienced mediator, especially as an expert in family law. In addition, he is generally familiar with business (\"business\"), immigration laws and cryptocurrencies. A colorful bouquet of legal competences, which he conveys to legal seekers in person, but also various radio programs; the corresponding transmission frequencies are included in the network. In the meantime, Wirecard has obtained help from the investment bank Houlihan Lokey, a specialist in difficult restructuring and insolvency cases, where ex-Bundesbank board member Andreas Dombret will start as a consultant in July.\n",

            " 30 years ago Oliver Erdmann hunted street dealers in Hamburg. Today, the chief commissioner is the head of the Joint Investigative Group Drugs (GER), where criminal police officers and customs officers work together to fight international drug-related crime. The group of about 20 people, who reside in the State Criminal Police Office in the Winterhude district, recently celebrated their 50th anniversary. Erdmann says: \"Anyone who buys a gram of cocaine must know that it also supports organized crime - criminals who oppose society.\" SPIEGEL: Mr. Erdmann, was it easier to hunt drug smugglers in the past? Erdmann: Yes, definitely. Globalization is also fueling drug dealers' businesses. You can easily exchange information across continents today, for example via WhatsApp. And the chance that the substance will go undetected when imported into Germany has increased significantly - due to the strong growth in goods traffic and the open borders in Europe. SPIEGEL: What role does Hamburg play in this? Erdmann: The port of Hamburg is the German hotspot for the import of cocaine, the hub of the game. Almost ten tons of cocaine were seized last year, a historic record. You have to keep in mind that roughly only ten percent of deliveries are intercepted. In truth, there could be almost 100 tons of cocaine smuggled in via Hamburg. SPIEGEL: Quite frustrating for you. Erdmann: You have to set realistic goals. The Joint Investigative Group Drugs wants to catch backers and dry out transport routes. This requires extensive investigations, which often take months. So you shouldn't set out to completely stop drug trafficking. That is not feasible. But we want to build up strong persecution pressure and make the perpetrators feel: You shouldn't feel safe.

            " Bill Cosby was convicted of sexual assault about two years ago - now the highest court in Pennsylvania has partially approved a motion by the US actor to appeal. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court has accepted two of Cosby's numerous objections, US media reported, citing court documents. According to the CNN broadcaster, an objection relates to witnesses who testified of alleged abuses that were not part of the indictment. The second objection is about the former district attorney's decision not to indict Cosby a decade ago. The former actor and comedian was \"extremely grateful\" for the court's decision, said spokesman Andrew Wyatt. Cosby has been in prison for sexual assault since 2018, where he has to serve a sentence of at least three and a maximum of ten years in prison. (Read more about this here.) Numerous previous applications for appeal and early release were rejected. The goal is his \"rehabilitation,\" said Cosby's wife Camille in an interview with TV channel ABC. None of the women who accuse Bill Cosby of sexual abuse have ever provided evidence. Bill and Camille Cosby have been married since 1964 and have five children together, two of whom have already died. \"You always loved and supported me and the children without restriction,\" wrote Bill Cosby on Instagram.\n",

            " Wirecard boss Markus Braun pulls out all the stops to get his company out of the negative headlines. \"It cannot currently be ruled out that Wirecard AG may have suffered considerable damage in the event of a fraud,\" explains CEO Markus Braun in an online video that the group referred to on Friday night. On Thursday, Wirecard again postponed the publication of the long-awaited annual financial statements for 2019. The auditor EY informed the company that \"that an audit report for the annual financial statements for the financial year 2019 requires further audit procedures due to unauthorized bank confirmations\", Braun explains again in the video. In terms of content, this is nothing new - on the other hand, the appearance of the Wirecard board represents a new dimension in crisis communication. Right at the start, Braun has to pause briefly to introduce the new board member James Freis - without further information on the reason for the change or the function that Exercise freely. Thanks to the predecessor, as the conventions usually provide when changing personnel, are also missing. Meanwhile, the price drama continues unabated: After the previous day's price drop of almost 62 percent, the papers of the payment processor lost almost half of their value in early Xetra trading. If the Group does not present a certified financial statement this Friday, there is a risk of termination of credit lines amounting to around two billion euros. The payment service provider has been in the focus of allegations of balance sheet for a few months. Among other things, the British newspaper \"Financial Times\" had reported about it repeatedly.\n",

            " The \"Guardian\" is already writing about a \"summer of raves\" that Britain has not seen since 1989. As a statement, the newspaper writes: The government has so far not given the young people hungry for social contacts in the corona crisis a legal perspective of partying. The potential for conflict in this supposedly small restriction has now become visible again in London: At least 15 police officers were injured in clashes over an illegal music event, the officials said. The night of Thursday the police had been called to the street event in Brixton, south of the city. The crowd gathered there did not respond to the police request to disperse, officials said. Rather, many people would have been hostile. Some police cars have been damaged. Unverified footage posted on social media shows a group attacking a police vehicle. Many residents reported in during the night and complained about a large crowd, noise, anti-social behavior, and violence, police commander Colin Wingrove said. The police responded. \"Such gatherings are illegal and pose a public health risk and a violation of coronavirus restrictions. Violence against officials is completely unacceptable and we will not tolerate it in any way.\" As early as the middle of the month, a total of 6000 people had gathered in two illegal raves in northern England - despite all the Corona bans. At one of the parties near Manchester, a man died suspected of drug overdose. After the second illicit party, also in Greater Manchester, the police investigated a rape case. The incidents in Great Britain are a parallel to the riots in downtown Stuttgart. There had been serious riots after a drug check on the night of Sunday after, according to the police, many partiers from the \"party and event scene\" showed solidarity against the officials would have. Police officers and patrol cars were attacked and some shops were ransacked.\n",

            " The Dutch government wants to ban e-cigarettes with the taste of strawberry ice cream, hazelnut paste or other sweet flavors. This will make e-cigarettes less attractive to young people, the Ministry of Health informed the parliament in The Hague. For young people, the e-cigarette is often the first step towards smoking conventional cigarettes. The ministry is referring to a new study that electronic cigarettes are more harmful than previously thought. Young people find \"vaping\" especially tasty with sweet flavors. The ban is part of a comprehensive campaign by the Ministry for a smoke-free young generation. It says: \"There is no room for e-cigarettes with all sorts of seductive exotic flavors.\" The US government recently announced that it would ban those models that are particularly popular with young people. Specifically, this affects e-cigarettes with cartridges already filled in flavors such as fruit and mint. After a 30-day period, companies face fines that violate the sales ban. However, contrary to what was originally announced, this does not affect liquids with flavors that can be used to fill other e-cigarettes with small tanks. The tobacco and menthol flavors are also completely excluded from the restriction. To justify the recently announced ban, the FDA announced that it wanted to tackle the increasing use of e-cigarettes among adolescents, but at the same time take into account adult users who wanted to get away from conventional tobacco products with e-cigarettes. The United States recently raised the minimum age to buy tobacco products and e-cigarettes from 18 to 21 years old.\n",

            " Three-way race for the top of the Eurogroup: Spaniard Nadia Calviño, Irish Paschal Donohoe and Luxembourg's Pierre Gramegna have declared their candidacy to chair the 19 economics and finance ministers of the common currency zone. The election will take place on July 9th. The influential position becomes vacant because the Portuguese finance minister Mario Centeno retires after a term in office. His mandate ends on July 12. The role of the Eurogroup is to lead and negotiate on issues related to the currency area. In April, Centeno brought the € 540 billion package of Corona loan assistance under one roof. The 53-year-old economist was nevertheless criticized as pale and not very assertive - also in comparison to the prominent predecessors Jean-Claude Juncker and Jereon Dijsselbloem. (Read an interview with Centeno from November 2019 here) Calviño would be the first woman to coordinate the fortunes of the 19 euro countries. She has many years of experience in the EU Commission in Brussels. The Federal Government should be open to a possible candidacy of the socialist. Finance Minister Olaf Scholz reports that she estimates. But Irish finance minister Donohoe is also applying, as he announced on Twitter. The 45-year-old politician of the Fine Gael party has been finance minister in Ireland since 2017. The Irish Times interprets his application for the chair of the Eurogroup as an indication that he remains in the Ministry of Finance. Four months after the general election, the bourgeois parties Fine Gael and Fianna Fail had reached an agreement with the Greens on a coalition agreement. There will be a ballot on Friday.

            " The third candidate is the Luxembourg Gramegna, finance minister of the small but financially strong EU country since 2013. \"Today's enormous challenges require consensus and compromise between all eurozone members,\" the 62-year-old liberal wrote on Twitter. \"I will use my six years of experience, all my energy and diplomacy for this task.\" The best chances are given to Calviño. She has been Minister of Economy since mid-2018. Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez had publicly advertised for her days ago. What speaks for her is that, like Centeno, she belongs to the social democratic camp and represents a southern EU state. According to popular reading, this least disturbs the balance of Brussels' top posts.\n",

In one photo you can see Malala covered with foam and colorful pieces of paper, in another she is sitting with her family in front of a large cake with the words \"Happy Graduation Malala\". She continues: \"I don't know what's in front of me. But for now, it will be Netflix, read and sleep.\" When she was eleven years old, the daughter of a school principal had campaigned for school visits to girls in Pakistan on a BBC blog. At that time, the Swat Valley was a stronghold of the Taliban, Malala described in the blog her life under the rule of the Islamists. In October 2012, a Taliban fighter shot her in the head when she was on a school bus in the Swat Valley. Malala survived seriously injured and was flown to Birmingham, UK for treatment, where she stayed with her family. In 2014 Malala received the Nobel Peace Prize at the age of 17. Together with the Indian activist Kailash Satyarthi, she was honored for her fight against the oppression of children and adolescents and for the right of all children to education. As the youngest Nobel laureate, Malala continues to campaign for girls. Many Pakistanis celebrated her when she visited Pakistan again for the first time in 2018 after the attack. But she is hostile to conservative circles in her homeland. You see her as an \"agent of the west\" whose mission is to expose Pakistan.\n",

            " The main suspect in the Madeleine McCann case is currently serving a sentence in Kiel and has filed for early release. The Federal Court of Justice should now comment on this. The reason: Between the courts in Kiel and Braunschweig, there are different opinions about which penal execution chamber is responsible for the decision locally, said the district court of Braunschweig. It was therefore decided to submit the procedure to the BGH in Karlsruhe. The 43-year-old detained in Kiel is suspected of kidnapping three-year-old Madeleine McCann from a holiday resort in Portugal in 2007. Investigators in Germany are convinced that the child is dead. The man has a criminal record for child sex offenses and is currently serving a sentence in Kiel, which the Niebüll District Court imposed on him in 2011. It was about drug trafficking. Detention is scheduled to end in spring 2021, two thirds of this sentence has been served. The Kiel Regional Court in Braunschweig rejected the application to put the rest on probation because the court had already dealt with the question there when the convict was still imprisoned in the Wolfenbüttel correctional facility before he was transferred to Kiel. The colleagues in Braunschweig, however, believe that their responsibilities have been closed because the application in Braunschweig was withdrawn. How the court responsible in the end would decide is open. Even if the application was approved, B. would probably not be released. In the meantime, the Braunschweig Regional Court sentenced B. to seven years in prison for raping a 72-year-old woman in the Algarve. In 2005, about a year and a half before the British girl's disappearance, he had passed away at the American in Praia da Luz. However, the judgment is not yet final; the revision is with the Federal Court of Justice. In addition, pre-trial detention is also conceivable, for example because of the risk of escape - as well as because of the allegations of Madeleine McCann's disappearance. When the girl disappeared from Praia da Luz in the Algarve, the man was 30 years old. He was a regular visitor to the region between 1995 and 2007. He was punished several times in both Germany and Portugal. His criminal record has 17 entries.\n",

            " The Germans are considered a cautious people. Every German citizen spends an average of more than 2,000 euros a year on insurance. But consumer advocates warn: Many people take out wrong insurance. Important risks are often not covered, but other aspects are completely overinsured. In order to find out what is really necessary, you should be aware of the risks in individual cases and whether you could cover them without insurance. You can only rely to a limited extent on the advice of insurance representatives. Finally, the seller receives a commission for every contract. This gives him an incentive to recommend his clients more than fewer policies. A simple rule is therefore important: Risks that mean total financial loss should be hedged. This includes, for example, liability damage caused to other people or third-party property - for example, the leaked washing machine that floods the entire apartment building or the injured pedestrian who was pushed onto the street by the cyclist. The amount of damage is theoretically unlimited here - insurance is therefore very useful. However, in the case of risks with potentially limited damage - such as on your own car and apartment - you should consider whether you could not pay the necessary amount yourself in the event of damage. If so, you can often save yourself the insurance premium. You can find an overview of which insurance is useful for whom here:\n",

            " Whether hearing, fine motor skills or frustration tolerance: In Germany, all children have to go to a school doctor before going to school and are checked both physically and cognitively. This so-called school entrance examination is mostly regulated in the respective school laws of the federal states. Because of the corona virus, school examinations have now failed in many places - because for the health authorities, where the examination normally takes place, coping with the pandemic was a top priority, as reported by the Bavarian Ministry of Health. That is why not all new school students were examined. The situation is similar in Bremen, Lower Saxony or Berlin. The Ministry of Health in North Rhine-Westphalia estimates that around 30 percent of school entry examinations have not yet taken place in North Rhine-Westphalia. The investigations have meanwhile continued, but countries such as NRW and Lower Saxony assume that they will not be able to make up all of the examinations by the beginning of the new school year. Of course, the children are still enrolled - although the examination is mandatory. But what are the consequences of possible failures for children and schools? Unlike in the past, the examinations are no longer about the children demonstrating their \"school readiness\". Rather, the focus is \"to determine the child's level of development so that the school can be made aware of any special funding needs,\" explains a Berlin health authority. From a pedagogical point of view, it is not necessarily a concern if the initial examinations have to be canceled this year, says the educational scientist Helga Kelle, who has researched school entrance examinations and teaches at Bielefeld University. In the meantime, children were closely observed that there were numerous appointments before the school examinations, such as the language proficiency test or the early detection examinations U1 to U9, to which the children were repeatedly invited from birth on at specified times. There are also numerous measures in the context of child protection and early help, in which children are looked at preventively before school. In addition, day care centers and schools worked closely together in many places and exchanged information about the children. It is therefore unlikely that children will not be noticed until the school exam. The State Center for Health in North Rhine-Westphalia also assumes that \"children with special needs and developmental delays have already been recognized in their previous path\". However, school entry examinations are the only examinations in most federal states in which theoretically no child can slip. Because the U-examinations are only compulsory in a few countries such as Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg. However, in most other federal states, the authorities also follow up when the children do not go to the pediatrician and sometimes even send youth welfare officers to their homes. The participation is correspondingly high. According to information from the Robert Koch Institute, 98 percent of children in Germany take part in the U9, which takes place around the 5th birthday and therefore at a similar time to the school enrollment. In families with a low socio-economic status and if both parents have a migration background, the proportion is somewhat lower at 96 and 95 percent, respectively. So it is quite conceivable that children who neither go to a daycare center nor to the U examinations fall through the grid. Norman Heise of the Berlin State Parents Committee, who represents the parents of schoolchildren in the capital, is primarily concerned with the fact that medical pre-existing conditions could not be identified as a result, such as damage to posture, which teachers also do not notice in everyday school life. The health ministries of the federal states emphasize how important they find the examinations; none of the requested countries want to miss the appointment with the medical officer without hesitation. Bremen, Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg, for example, assume that they can make up for the examination right up to the start of school, which should work particularly well in the provinces, as the examination takes place in the penultimate year of kindergarten. Saxony, for example, reports that the investigation of the prospective first graders had already been completed by the end of January - before the pandemic broke out. In North Rhine-Westphalia and Lower Saxony, on the other hand, you adjust yourself to the fact that not all children are examined until the start of school - and speak out in favor of inviting children with special needs. The State Center for Health of North Rhine-Westphalia has worked out how this might look. Educators and teachers are therefore called upon to contact the child and adolescent health service after consultation with parents if they have children with a noticeable level of development or special needs in the daycare center or in their future class. In addition, in the current exceptional situation, it is conceivable to preferentially invite certain groups to the school enrollment examination. These are children who have not appeared at the U9 and children from districts where the initial examinations in the past have shown above-average need for support or further medical clarification. The Ministry of Health of North Rhine-Westphalia also points out the possibility that the local health authorities can also commission third parties to carry out the examination, for example resident doctors.\n",

            " Corona's leading US immunologist, Anthony Fauci, has expressed concern about a significant increase in the number of cases of coronavirus infections in several states. Fauci spoke at a hearing in the House of Representatives on Tuesday of a \"worrying increase in infections\" in Florida, Texas, Arizona, among others. However, US President Donald Trump downplayed the recent surge in infections in the United States on Tuesday. \"If we test more, we will find more cases,\" he said. \"Testing is a double-edged sword.\" The United States has run more than 25 million tests, more than any other country. Trump had already said at a rally on Saturday: \"If you test to this extent, you will find more people, you will find more cases, so I said to my people: 'Please slow down the tests.'\" Was called from the White House it then, Trump \"obviously kidding\". However, the President said on Tuesday when asked about his statement, \"I'm not kidding.\" Fauci said Tuesday that no one from the White House Coronavirus Working Group had ever been instructed to slow tests. \"The opposite is the case. We will test more, not less.\" The next few weeks are crucial to counteract the increase, Fauci said. But there are also successes in the fight against the virus in the USA. In New York State, for example, the number of cases has been reduced. Trump is campaigning for a quick reopening of the economy and wants - probably also with a view to the election in November - a return to normality as quickly as possible. According to him, the corona virus is gradually disappearing from the United States. Most renowned experts reject Trump's statement that the increase in infections is primarily due to an increase in tests. They are primarily responsible for the relaxation of corona restrictions. The daily newly registered cases in the USA are around 30,000 again - that's just a little less than at the height of the crisis in April. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo told NBC on Tuesday: \"We are seriously considering quarantine just to ensure that people from countries with higher infection rates do not accidentally increase our infection rate.\" By this, the governor means a usually two-week, mandatory quarantine that is imposed on immigrants from corresponding states. Fauci said the tremendous efforts to find a vaccine are progressing. He remains confident that an effective vaccine will be available early next year. But there is no guarantee. The United States is the country with the most identified coronavirus infections worldwide. More than 2.3 million cases have been recorded since the pandemic started. More than 120,000 people died after being infected with the Sars-CoV-2 pathogen.\n",

That was decided unanimously by the North Rhine-Westphalian state parliament. At the Loveparade on July 24, 2010, 21 people died in the crowd in Duisburg, 650 people were injured. At the beginning of May, the long-standing lawsuit in search of culprits was ended. One of the most complex post-war criminal trials ended without judgment. At the commemorative event in the state parliament, Hannelore Kraft (SPD) expressed her sympathy to the victims and their relatives. The former Prime Minister of North Rhine-Westphalia read out the first names of the dead. It is difficult for those affected to bear that the criminal trial ended without judgments. Wounds, disappointments and anger would remain, it said in a statement by the state parliament. But the state parliament can make a gesture to the victims and relatives from the heart: \"We ask for your forgiveness,\" said Kraft. Kraft was in office for ten days at the time of the Loveparade disaster. Even today she says: \"The Love Parade disaster is an open wound in the heart of the city and the country.\" The state parliament wants to set up a commission to prevent tragedies like the mass panic at the Love Parade in the future.

The number has increased significantly in recent years, said the SPD politician in Berlin. Compared to data provided by the ministry three years ago in February, this is an increase of 44 percent. Most women affected came from Eritrea, Somalia, Indonesia, Egypt and Nigeria, said Giffey. The reason for the increase is due to higher immigration from these countries. Franziska Giffey Giffey said that it was not easy to collect such data. \"It is a criminal offense, so we are doing darkfield research here.\" According to the information provided by the Ministry, the survey was carried out using a methodology developed by the European Institute for Gender Equality. \"Female genital mutilation is a serious human rights violation and an archaic offense that violates girls and women 's right to physical integrity and sexual self-determination,\" said Giffey. The aim is to protect girls and young women from it and to offer help. Midwives could provide support for those affected. Giffey also referred to the nationwide help line \"Violence against women\", which is also available around the clock with multilingual contacts.\n",

Despite information from relatives, the officials did not assume a \"danger to life and limb\", said Frank Otto of the Saxony Police in the ZDF magazine \"frontal 21\". A cross-border group of police experts had worked on their own approach for six months and was now looking to speak to relatives. The student Sophia L. wanted to hitchhike from Leipzig to Nuremberg in June 2018. She wanted to go home for her father's birthday, but the 28-year-old never arrived there. Her body was later discovered in a ditch in Spain. In September 2019, the Bayreuth District Court sentenced a truck driver to life imprisonment for murder and dangerous bodily harm. In the past, relatives had repeatedly accused the authorities of delaying the investigation and ignoring important information. The police also wrote calls to the shipping company after the fact in the log, said Sophia's brother in the television report. \"It is important to us that things go better next time. That the next victim and his relatives are shown more empathy and willingness to work,\" emphasized the brother. \"And that it will not be so terrible for the next affected.\" According to their own statements, the criminal police now draw their lessons from it - but at best they appear vague. \"It may well be that individual steps are not immediately transferred to a comprehensive calendar,\" said Holger Baumbach from the Bavarian Criminal Police in an interview with ZDF. Investigating officials should now react more sensitively to information from relatives, a guide will help.\n",

It is not the first prominent company name on a still manageable list, which also includes the outdoor outfitters The North Face and Patagonia, the clothing chain Eddie Bauer and the film distributor Magnolia Pictures. US civil rights organizations had called on companies to boycott last week. So Facebook should be hit in a sensitive place. The group makes almost all of its sales with advertising revenue. However, thousands of companies would probably have to participate to leave a visible dent in the balance sheet of the Internet company. The criticism that Facebook is careless about controversial posts has flared up again due to the wave of protests against racism and police violence. Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg also contributed to this by refusing to take action against statements by US President Donald Trump, which sanctioned competitor Twitter. According to the \"New York Times\" and the \"Wall Street Journal\", some advertising agencies as well as other companies are silently participating in the boycott. Most, writes the \"New York Times\", but would continue to post on Facebook and assume that after July they will start showing ads on the platform again. Facebook sent an email to some of its biggest customers, saying it had taken further steps to deal with potentially harmful content. Ben & Jerry's website said Facebook needed to do more to \"prevent its platform from dividing America from being used, to suppress voters, to ignite the flames of racism and violence, and to undermine our democracy.\" Therefore, join the #StopHateForProfit initiative and stop all paid ads on Facebook and Instagram in the US from July 1 until further notice.

            " In large parts of Africa and Asia, people were able to witness a special solar eclipse this Sunday: the moon moved between the earth and the sun so that it released a luminous ring. Such an annular eclipse can only be seen about every two years and only from a small part of the earth. The first thing to see was the ring-shaped solar eclipse in the northeast of the Republic of the Congo, where it got dark again just a few minutes after sunrise at 5.56 a.m. local time (6.56 a.m.CET). The sky spectacle lasted one minute and 22 seconds - longer than anywhere else. In Nairobi, clouds partially obscured the view of the eclipse. Still, the sight was \"very exciting,\" said Susan Murbana of the Traveling Telescope organization, which runs astronomical educational programs for children. Because of the corona pandemic, she was unable to organize an excursion this year, Murbana said. However, dozens of people had taken part in a live broadcast on the occasion of the solar eclipse on the Internet services Zoom and Facebook. The phenomenon migrated from Africa in a narrow strip across the Arabian Peninsula and India to China and Taiwan. The solar eclipse peaked above Uttarakhand on the Indian-Chinese border at 12.10 p.m. local time. There the phenomenon lasted only 38 seconds. The spectacle could not be seen from Central Europe. In the south and east of the continent, observers could experience it as a partial solar eclipse - the sun is only partially covered by the moon. At least that will be seen in Germany at the next annular solar eclipse - assuming good weather conditions. It will take place in less than a year, on June 10, 2021. The next total solar eclipse will take place on December 14. It will mainly be seen from South America.\n",

In at least one hospital in the region, hospital staff are said to have estimated the alcohol value of incoming indigenous patients and have placed bets on it. The Ministry of Health of the Province of British Columbia in the west of the country announced on Friday. \"If that is true, it is intolerable, unacceptable and racist,\" said Health Minister Adrian Dix. An investigation had been launched. It was not announced which clinic it is. According to the allegations, the bets in the emergency room of the hospital are said to have run. The bet was made on patients where doctors and nurses assumed on arrival that they had indigenous roots. The winner was the one who was closest to the possible blood alcohol level determined later with his estimate. As the British BBC reports, the participants are said to have named the game after the popular game show \"The Price Is Right\". A clinic was therefore named in the original complaint. However, the investigation would now address racism allegations by employees across the healthcare system. Health Minister Dix expects further cases to come to light. The complaint was filed by Daniel Fontaine, chairman of Métis Nation British Columbia, according to the BBC. Earlier, a hospital staff member mentioned the game across the street. Fontaine told the BBC that he was not surprised. The government had known for years that there was racism in the health system. The current incidents caused outrage among other things in the representation of interests of indigenous peoples. People with indigenous roots are \"far too often victims of prejudice,\" she said. There are always reports that hospitals refuse to treat seriously ill indigenous people because they are said to be \"only\" drunk.\n",

            " Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann believes that the German economy did well in the corona crisis. The worst phase was over, he said in an interview with the \"Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung\". Economic output in the second quarter was certainly much more pronounced than in the first, but \"the low point should be behind us now and things are looking up again\". However, the sharp slump \"only results in a comparatively gradual recovery\". The Bundesbank President emphasized that in the event of a bankruptcy wave in autumn, the state had enough scope to support the economy again. \"Politicians reacted quickly and courageously in a difficult environment to protect companies and employees. That was correct.\" Politicians should not get used to the high level of debt - and would have to readjust again and again, as the further development is difficult to foresee. \"We have to avoid that temporary difficulties become permanent problems. Actually healthy companies shouldn't break down,\" said Weidmann. \"It is important that the measures are targeted and temporary.\" Afterwards, it was crucial to return to a solid budget. Timely changeover is also important in the monetary policy of the European Central Bank. \"It must be clear that if monetary policy normalization is necessary with a view to price developments, it must not be omitted out of consideration for government financing costs.\" If, in January, the VAT, which was reduced from 19 to 16 percent or from 7 to 5 percent for half a year on July 1, is raised again to its old rate, the rate of inflation could rise again. Inflation in Germany had dropped to its lowest level in more than three and a half years in May. The annual inflation rate was 0.6 percent. The European Central Bank (ECB) is aiming for an annual inflation rate of just under 2.0 percent for the entire euro area with its 19 countries in the medium term. Because permanently low or falling prices postpone investments, which slows down the economy. It is not clear whether the inflation rate will rise again this year. Weidmann said: \"If less is produced because the factories have had to shut down on order or the global supply chains have been interrupted, prices tend to go up.\" But he also limited: \"At the same time, consumers are more likely to stay at home and we are seeing a decline in demand in some areas, such as clothing. This has a price-reducing effect.\" Regarding the state's controversial holdings in companies, as provided for by the Lufthansa rescue plan, or in the vaccine manufacturer Curevac, Weidmann said: \"On the one hand, it is correct that the state not only provides liquidity, but also capital to help the collapse prevent healthy companies. \" But it is already bothering him that calls for industrial policy interventions are becoming more fashionable. \"That shouldn't be the standard for normal times.\"\n",

            " There are said to have been times when Karl-Erivan and Christian Haub were really fat. At least officially. For years, the brothers jointly ran Tengelmann, the trading company that has large holdings in well-known brands such as Obi, Kik and Tedi. The two brothers, the company claimed in 2018, \"made all the key decisions together\". But in fact, they were much more often competitors in the family group - not least because of the favor of the old company patriarch Erivan Haub. Karl-Erivan \"Charly\" Haub seemed to have won this race at some point. His brother Christian, four years his junior, overdid himself in the group with the difficult restructuring of the A&P food chain in the USA. Karl-Erivan, on the other hand, was able to distinguish itself here in Germany with investments in digital companies such as Zalando or Babymarkt.de - and with perseverance in selling the Kaiser's Tengelmann supermarkets. This history is important to get an idea of ​​why both branches of the family are now on trial. And the word branches is also important. Because Karl-Erivan Haub has been missing since 2018, since a ski tour on the Matterhorn. Rescue operations lasting several days were unsuccessful. The search has been stopped. A few weeks earlier, company patriarch Erivan Haub died at the age of 85. Maybe Christian Haub saw his hour in this situation. He returned from the USA to the Ruhr area and took over the executive chair in the retail group alone. Charly Haub's wife Katrin, on the other hand, is likely to see the influence of her branch and lots of money disappear with the disappearance of her husband and has sued the group now headed by the brother-in-law. This Friday, the second chamber for commercial matters at the Duisburg regional court wants to announce a decision in this dispute within one of the richest entrepreneurial families in Germany. But Tengelmann should not come to rest. It starts with the fact that there was a funeral service for Karl-Erivan Haub, but Katrin Haub is at least not legally a widow. Together with their children Viktoria and Erivan, she is on trial in the name of her husband, who has still not been declared dead. It has an absence attendance with which it can also exercise its voting rights. The other voting rights are held by Christian and another brother Georg, who has not been involved in the operational business for a long time. The division also means: The family branches can block each other in important decisions, Tengelmann has fallen into the same trap as Aldi. And as with Aldi, Tengelmann is now concerned with the formalities of a statute. This time around the question of whether a two-thirds or a three-quarters majority was necessary to appoint a member to the powerful company advisory board, as a court spokeswoman explains. Franz Markus Haniel is affected by the proxy war in the family branches. He had joined the Tengelmann Advisory Board in November 2018 with a two-thirds majority. The court must now decide whether that is enough. As a controller and consultant, the 65-year-old long-time Metro manager from the well-known Haniel dynasty of Duisburg has plenty of experience with troubled retail groups. The problem with this supposed ideal cast could be that he replaced Thomas Kramer on the committee, a long-time confidante of Karl-Erivan Haub. Christian Haub enthusiastically praised Haniel's entry at the time: \"We are very impressed by his entrepreneurial vision, his experience and expertise in our industry and his international orientation.\" In addition to Haniel, the advisory board currently also includes Christoph von Grolman, head of an investment firm in the Thyssen-Bornemisza family, and former Edeka boss Alfons Frenk. The third Haub brother Georg left the advisory board after only one and a half years. It seems as if he is holding back in the power struggle between the family branches. Katrin Haub and her twins are fighting it - in public, too, in court. The reasons for this can only be guessed at - also because Katrin Haub, despite request, is unable to obtain an opinion. According to one reading, the lawsuit is intended to increase the pressure on the company in order to solve the inheritance question, which has been open since the father's disappearance. Because if Charly Haub is declared dead and the two children inherit the father's company shares, inheritance taxes of an estimated 450 million euros are due. So far, the Charly Haubs branch and the group have not been able to agree on who should pay the taxes. A Tengelmann spokesman emphasizes: \"We would be interested in constructive solutions.\" But another reading is also conceivable: the manager magazin had reported that Christian Haub speculated on pushing his niece and nephew out of the group. The high inheritance tax could enable them to sell their shares, according to the report, there was a real division in the room. The process around the Haniel personnel may therefore only be a desperate attempt to prevent further concentration of power in Christian Haub's family branch. The chances are good. At the hearing on May 22, the Duisburg court signaled that it tended to agree with the plaintiffs. In the past, a three-quarters majority was always required when filling comparable advisory board positions. Christian Haub, meanwhile, shows little restraint. He is not just the sole boss of the Tengelmann Group, but has continued to rebuild the group since the disappearance of his brother. The former supermarket empire has long been a broad-based family equity investor - i.e. above all an investment group with almost eight billion euros in sales in 2018 and more than 90,000 employees. That means family office. If it weren't for the family. Case number: 22 O 65/19\n",

            " Things are still going well for Thorsten Harke, surprisingly well. The Mülheim-based entrepreneur delivers chemical and pharmaceutical products to Great Britain: tablets, cosmetics, disinfectants. Much of it is currently in demand worldwide; The gross profit of his group of companies grew by about 25 percent in the first half of the year. And the business on the island plays a large part in this because many market segments are \"in a special situation due to Corona\", says Harke. However, the situation could change quickly. If the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson does not soon conclude a far-reaching trade agreement with the European Union, Harkes 165 employees will soon face a lot of unproductive work. Great Britain would become an EU third country such as India or Egypt, its people would have to calculate longer transport times, change contracts or observe new regulations: import rules, for example, or product approvals. This drives costs, while new tariffs would reduce earnings at the same time. \"By a few percent,\" says Harke, Brexit could then \"depress gross profit and make some businesses unprofitable\".

            " Sometime after midnight, a young man with blue mouth and nose protection speaks to a photographer on Stuttgart's Marienstrasse and says: \"Take a picture of me\" - this is how the photographer says this Monday on the phone. The situation had escalated long ago, young men threw bottles and stones at police officers, threw windows on Marienstrasse and the neighboring Königstrasse, and looted businesses. In the midst of the chaos, young people pulled out their cell phones and filmed - this is how the photographer observed it, and so it suggests various clips that are circulating on the Internet. The man with the respirator mask was posing self-portrayed. \"The consequences were probably not clear to people,\" says the photographer, who wants to remain anonymous. The consequences: 24 people were temporarily arrested, an arrest warrant has been executed, the prosecutor said, and a further seven have been applied for. The suspects are between 16 and 33 years old and have German, Croatian, Iraqi, Portuguese and Latvian citizenship. They are accused of breaching the peace, as well as dangerous bodily harm, physical attacks on enforcement officers and theft in particularly serious cases. A 16-year-old is being investigated for attempted manslaughter. And in the coming weeks, at least the state authorities leave no doubt about it, numerous further investigations will be added. Up to 500 people are said to have contributed to Stuttgart's rioting night. The balance is devastating: 19 police officers were injured, twelve police cars, an ambulance and 40 shops were damaged, nine shops were ransacked. Stuttgart Police Vice President Thomas Berger put the damage caused by the marauding groups in a six- to seven-digit amount. The fatal impression left by the night weighs even more heavily: How did such an escalation come about? How to explain the curiosity and pride in the riot? And how about the state's loss of control for hours? It started around 11:30 p.m. when a 17-year-old German at Eckensee was due to be checked for a suspected drug offense. Thereupon 200 to 300 people immediately showed solidarity with the young man and massively attacked the police officers present, the police say. In small groups, the young people rioted towards Schlossplatz and later on Königstrasse to Marienstrasse. Baden-Württemberg's Prime Minister Winfried Kretschmann (Greens) speaks of an \"orgy of violence\" without cause, against which liberal democracy will prove \"defensive\". Stuttgart Mayor Fritz Kuhn (Greens) calls the perpetrators \"criminals who are ready to commit serious crimes\". Federal Interior Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU) demonstratively shows himself in Stuttgart in front of a destroyed police car, which the police say was driven back into the city center especially for the press appointment, and says that he expects \"severe punishments\" for the perpetrators. The riot is an \"alarm signal for the rule of law\". Federal Interior Minister Seehofer (CSU, r.) And the Interior Minister of Baden-Württemberg, Thomas Strobl, in front of the police car. While the police are still investigating the background of the rioters, they are already certain for some: The AfD parliamentary group leader in the Bundestag, Alice Weidel, writes on Twitter of \"Antifa and 'Migrantifa'\" that are \"out of control\". When visiting Seehofer there was obviously a well-known right-wing extremist blogger. \"Merkel's guests were,\" was the interjection. According to Stefanie Hinz, the Baden-Württemberg state police chief, the police \"see no condensed evidence that there is actually a political motivation or, accordingly, a religious motivation behind these acts\". The photographer who was there on Sunday night also says: \"It was not a homogeneous mass.\" According to him, hundreds of people were sitting on the stairs to the Little Palace Square, some of whom would have called \"ACAB\" - the slogan stands for \"All cops are bastards\". \"That was the common denominator,\" says the photographer. \"We against the police.\" The looting was then \"apparently more about destructive rage\". For many, the riot had \"an event character\". Baden-Württemberg's Interior Minister Thomas Strobl (CDU) says the rioters come from the \"party scene\", alcohol and drugs were involved. Problems with revelers in the Stuttgart center around Eckensee have existed for years. Especially in summer there is often stress and fights. According to police crime statistics, the Stuttgart-Mitte district had the most cases of the 23 districts with almost 14,700 crimes in 2019. A round table was therefore founded in 2013. Even then, residents in the center complained about noise, broken glass and party people who urinated in the house entrances. Since then, emissaries from the catering trade, the police and the city administration have been discussing possible solutions once a month. Because of the corona crisis, however, the last meeting of the working group took place online in mid-March. Many of the celebrants apparently come from the Stuttgart area. \"At the weekend it is so loud that I cannot sleep without an earropax,\" said Stuttgart city dean Christian Hermes. He lives in the house of the Catholic Church in the immediate vicinity of Eckensee. He has been observing mobbing, disrespect to the police and littering outside his door for years, says Hermes. \"It looks like a pig here on a Sunday morning.\" The public space is neglected, the city must act now. This could not be regulated only with a police presence, said Hermes. \"We have to get to the youngsters, especially those who grow up in a macho culture. They often lack respect for the police and other authorities.\" The police have meanwhile set up a 40-member investigation team and have activated an information portal. In addition to investigating the crimes, it is now also a question of how the city wants to guarantee security in public space in the future. Mayor Kuhn wants to present the first solutions before the coming weekend. According to the city, a management committee should advise on topics such as video surveillance, alcohol bans or residence restrictions for public places. Youth and migrant work such as street worker offers and cooperation with retailers and the club scene, for example, were also discussed. In addition to the committee, a round table should bring together representatives of the club scene and retail, the city said. The police have announced that they will be on the move in Stuttgart in the coming weeks with increased strength. State Interior Minister Strobl promised to support the city in developing a security concept. There will be \"no legal spaces\" in Baden-Württemberg, he said. Such riots have \"never existed in Stuttgart, and there must be no second\". Note: In an earlier version of this article, the Stuttgart city dean was called Clemens Fürst. In fact, his name is Christian Hermes. We have corrected the mix-up. In addition, this text was updated after a reader's note and further research: The presence of a right-wing blogger was added to make the context clearer.\n",

            " China has released the genome of the virus strain that caused another corona outbreak in Beijing. The genetic sequence was made available to the World Health Organization (WHO) and scientists around the world on Thursday. The authorities in Beijing said so. The much-visited Beijing Xinfadi market, where more than 70 percent of fresh food for Beijing is sold, is believed to be the starting point for the renewed outbreak in China. Sars-CoV-2 was detected there on cutting boards on which imported salmon had been cut up. However, scientists warn of premature conclusions. It is considered unlikely that salmon will become infected with the corona virus and thus be able to transmit it to humans. However, the virus could have reached the fish or the cutting boards due to poor hygiene - possibly already during the export. China appears to be relatively certain that the new outbreak is due to Europe: Initial genome analysis indicated that this strain of virus \"came from Europe,\" said Zhang Yong of the Chinese Disease Control Agency, a report by the state-run newspaper Global Times \"according to. However, the virus strain is \"older than the virus that is currently circulating in Europe,\" said Zhang. Perhaps the virus found in and around Beijing originated from frozen foods or a food market.

            " \"The samples found in the Xinfadi market indicate that the virus has been circulating for a while,\" said Zhang. \"If it had just arrived in the city a short time ago, there would not have been so many positive cases.\" However, you would need more data before you can make a reliable statement about the origin of the virus. Zhang said on the website of the Chinese Communist Party, according to the \"Global Times\". Ben Cowling, a professor of public health at the University of Hong Kong, told AFP news agency that \"it is possible that the virus that is now causing the outbreak in Beijing has traveled from Wuhan to Europe and now back to China.\" The first person infected by the new outbreak had not yet been identified, so the origin of the outbreak could not be determined. The gene researcher François Balloux from University College London wrote in the online service Twitter that the genome does not allow any conclusions to be drawn about the origin of the virus. It could \"basically come from anywhere\". However, the genome suggested that the virus had been transmitted from person to person for a while before the outbreak was identified.

            " After two months without infection, infections with the novel coronavirus were found again last week. 25 more infections were confirmed in Beijing on Friday, meaning that there are now 183 new cases in the Chinese capital. The authorities took extensive measures to contain the pandemic, such as school closures and mass tests. The people of Beijing have to do without unnecessary trips, residents of high-risk areas within the city are not allowed to leave the metropolis of 21 million. The US accuses China of not tackling the original outbreak in China consistently enough. Washington also blames the Chinese government for the many cases in the United States and accuses it of reacting too slowly. China denies the allegations, noting, among other things, that scientists published the genome sequence as quickly as possible after the Wuhan outbreak. The determination of the genetic sequence of a virus is one of the most important methods for analyzing the origin and the probable spread of a virus. The genome sequence can be used to clearly identify a virus strain and, for example, develop specific test procedures or trace mutations.\n",

            " There was a farewell meeting with his seriously ill brother in the morning, then Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI traveled. back to the Vatican. The former pontiff was in his old home of Regensburg for five days to be close to Georg Ratzinger. The aircraft of the Italian Air Force took off at Munich Airport shortly before 12 noon on Monday. After a one-hour flight, the 93-year-old arrived in Rome with his entourage, which included his private secretary Georg Gänswein. A Vatican spokesman said. Prime Minister Markus Söder (CSU) said goodbye to the former pope on the airport tarmac. For this purpose, Söder postponed a meeting of the CSU party executive. That is a question of respect and honor, said Söder. He spoke of a moment of joy and sadness, after all, the reason for the visit was not an easy one. Prime Minister Markus Söder gave the emeritus pope a gift basket on the way - filled with Bavarian beer, white sausages and mustard, among other things been. It was the ninth meeting of the two in five days. These meetings had obviously been good for the brothers, it was said from the surrounding area. The 96-year-old Georg Ratzinger, long-time director of the Regensburger Domspatzen, is almost completely blind and bedridden. Bishop Rudolf Voderholzer said on Monday: \"It was felt how much Benedikt blossomed when he saw the landscape, the familiar alleys and paths and above all the people through the windows of his van.\" In addition to his brother, Benedikt visited three places in his heart that are close to his heart: his former home in the Pentling community, the grave of his parents and sister, and the Regensburg Cathedral. Since retiring as Pope, Benedict has lived in a monastery in the Vatican. The Bishop of Regensburg described the retired Pope as relying heavily on outside help, \"for practically all everyday life accomplishments he needs the help of others.\" The articulation is also obviously a problem for him. \"But his thoughts are completely clear - his memory, his combination gift phenomenal.\" He had to fully mobilize his remaining strength to say goodbye. \"We encountered Benedict XVI in all his aged weaknesses and we were able to experience and experience what is really important at the end of every day, with all human size and creativity,\" said Voderholzer. The Permanent Council of the German Bishops' Conference expressed his solidarity with the 93-year-old. \"We are pleased that you have taken on the strain of a trip to your Bavarian homeland again,\" it said in a letter published on Monday. It was felt how important Benedikt was to meet his brother. The word of the Pope, \"He who believes is never alone\", has shaped the Church in Germany to this day. \"We are united with you in faith, even in difficult times.\"\n",

            " The corona outbreak at Germany's largest slaughterhouse, Tönnies, has serious consequences: thousands are in official quarantine, and more than a thousand tests related to the outbreak at Tönnies have already been positive. A regional lockdown in the Gütersloh district, however, should initially not exist. This was announced by North Rhine-Westphalia's Prime Minister Armin Laschet during a local visit. There is \"an enormous pandemic risk,\" said the CDU politician. The infection process is clearly localizable at the company Tönnies, and there is no \"significant jump\" into the population. That is why, according to Laschet, it continues to apply that \"we cannot rule out a comprehensive lockdown at the moment, but as long as we do everything we can, that it does not skip to the population, we can take other better targeted measures.\" He cited school closures and quarantine measures as examples. The approximately 7,000 employees who worked on the factory premises have been in quarantine since Friday. In the meantime, almost all tests have been completed. Laschet did not publish a current figure about the positive findings. On Saturday afternoon, the number of infected people rose to 1,029. At this point, those responsible had already evaluated 3,127 tests. Laschet had attended a meeting of the crisis team in the Gütersloh district together with Health Minister Karl-Josef Laumann (CDU) in the morning. Representatives of the embassies of Romania, Poland and Bulgaria were also present at the meeting. The Prime Minister subsequently offered the Gütersloh district additional help. In addition to the forces already deployed, the country is ready \"to organize all the personnel that are needed,\" said Laschet. The most important thing now is the contact tracking of infected people and strict compliance with the quarantine. Both health authorities in the country and the police would provide more resources. Laschet thanked all emergency services on site in the crisis team. Everyone involved, from municipalities to the fire brigade, the police and the German armed forces, right up to medical services, did a \"great job\" in order to keep \"the infection process around the Tönnies company that was unique in this form\" under control. It was announced on Wednesday that an outbreak with a large number of people infected with corona had occurred among the employees of the largest German slaughterhouse in Tönnies near Rheda-Wiedenbrück. The company is now coming under increasing pressure. The crisis team had already announced on Saturday that the authorities had gained access to the personnel lists in a kind of raid. The company had previously been reluctant to issue the necessary documents. \"The trust we place in Tönnies is zero,\" said Thomas Kuhlbusch, head of the crisis team. The former Federal Data Protection Commissioner Peter Schaar criticized Tönnies' statements on Sunday. The controversial co-owner Clemens Tönnies had also spoken out. Despite massive criticism from his own company, he continues to refuse to resign. \"I will lead this company out of this crisis,\" said the 64-year-old at a press conference in Rheda-Wiedenbrück on Saturday.\n",

            " Minds are heated. The psychiatric expert opposes the defense's request that the court reject it because of concern about bias and obtain a new opinion. A lawyer denies the plaintiff's allegation that she would turn a victim into a perpetrator. And at some point a defendant calls into the hall: \"All people who use drugs want sex!\" It is about the alleged group rape of an 18-year-old on one night in October 2018. For a year now, eleven young men have had to answer to the juvenile chamber of the Freiburg Regional Court. They deny rape and claim that the young woman wanted sex. Four defendants have since been released from custody. In three of them the chamber sees no urgent suspicion, in the fourth there is no longer any risk of escape. The young woman had consumed alcohol and ecstasy. The public prosecutor believes that the ecstasy tablet was particularly high in doses. The 18-year-old had no experience with drugs. What the men did with her in the bushes next to a Freiburg discotheque, she only vaguely noticed, she indicated. At the time, she largely lost control of her body. The report by Professor Torsten Passie, a psychiatrist from Hanover, deals, among other things, with the question of how ecstasy has affected the woman's ability to develop willpower and resistance. It is a crucial question. Because the sexual abuse of an incapable person is rape. Defense is about minutes. Defense lawyer Hanna Palm said on Wednesday: \"I have only one question for Professor Passie: Was the woman unable to train and unable to defend herself at 0.35 am or not?\" Her client, Timo P., is said to have raped the woman shortly before 0.35 a.m. He denies that. In his account, he did not rape her, but rather seduced him. Defense lawyer Palm does not get an answer to her question. The defenders Palm and Kerstin Oetjen accuse Passie, among other things, of having adjusted his expert opinion in court so that the woman could have been defenseless by the time she met Timo P. Passie contests this allegation and other defense allegations. In no way did he change his findings in court \"in a blatant manner\". The defense had rather misunderstood him. He does not want to have said many sentences that defense lawyer Oetjen mentions in her applications. \"I would like to point out that I have a shorthand that enables me to take notes verbatim,\" defender Oetjen said. The prosecutor is not impressed. The application for rejection was rejected and a new report was not required, says the prosecutor. He does not claim that Oetjen misrepresented the assessor's words at the trial. However, their presentation was \"incomplete and selective\". Professor Passie himself had previously commented on the allegations. This time he prefers not to speak freely, but to read his statement. He noticed that the defense pays attention to every word. Passie repeatedly emphasizes that the alleged crime scene that night was a \"complex\" and \"very dynamic\" event in which a variety of factors played a role. The fact that, from his point of view, in particular from around 0.50 a.m. an incapacity to defend and from around 0.40 a.m. from an incapacity to train the woman does not mean that neither of these abilities had previously been impaired or could no longer exist. The expert also does not want to have said: \"From my professional point of view, a deadlock reflex like in the animal kingdom is possible here.\" The defense contradicts that he said this very well. She sees a contradiction between a stiffness and the woman's statements that she can remember a taste, change of position, sand and twigs in her hand. Passie's written report also mentions a deadlock reflex. In addition, the expert now states in any case: \"Incidentally, a shock-related restriction of physical mobility does not have to be complete and has no necessary connection with memory disorders.\" The defense's refusal of the expert was only shaped by the desire to get rid of \"an annoying result,\" said the prosecutor. From a defense perspective, such a result should be that ecstasy tends not to increase sexual need. Not only Passie had done that, but also a toxicologist from the Freiburg University Clinic. Defense lawyer Oetjen has now referred the court to a study from 2016 that ecstasy may be sexually stimulating. Psychiatrist Passie convincingly tears the study off this Wednesday. He speaks not only of methodological shortcomings and inaccuracies, but of a \"catastrophe\". His conclusion: \"The study cannot be used. From a scientific point of view, there is actually nothing wrong with it. I'm sorry that I have to say that.\" It is the moment when Oetjen's client interrupts loudly. He looks at the court. \"Everyone is lying, only he is right?\" He asks, pointing to the expert. He will receive an answer with the judgment. If the court's plan goes, it could still fall in July.\n",

The Tanzanian is the father of more than 30 children, a miner - and recently a millionaire. At work, Laizer came across the two largest Tanzanite gemstones ever discovered in Tanzania, according to reports by the British Guardian, among others. According to the Ministry of Mining, the two chunks together weigh 15 kilograms - and the equivalent of about $ 3.4 million in Laizer's family fund. Tanzanites are processed into gemstones, and they are only found in the north of the East African country. According to the BBC, local geologists believe that the entire occurrence of tanzanite in humans will be brought to light within the next 20 years. Saniniu Laizer The two stones now found weigh 9.2 and 5.8 kilograms, the heaviest tanzanite to date only weighed a little over three kilos. Laizer was delighted with the find. \"There will be a big party tomorrow,\" he told the BBC. \"I want to build a mall and school,\" said Laizer. \"There are so many poor people here who can't send their children to school.\" He himself never went to school, so it was all the more important to him to do things professionally.

            " The European Central Bank (ECB) wants to bring Europe through the corona crisis by buying trillions of government bonds. But the side effects of this policy are enormous: cheap money ensures that share prices shoot up again despite the severe economic crisis - and the rich get richer again. The ECB's Vice President, Spaniard Luis de Guindos, does not see the central bank as responsible for this. \"The best policy against social inequality is to create growth and jobs,\" he said in an interview with SPIEGEL. \"Monetary policy has helped a lot to achieve that.\" De Guindos is nevertheless critical of the euphoria on the stock markets. \"We know (...) that markets sometimes overreact,\" he says. Ultimately, the stock exchanges should remain realistic: \"We are facing a recession in the euro area.\" Although lawsuits against ultra-loose monetary policy are constantly coming from Germany, de Guindos only wants to report good things about the government in Berlin and the Bundesbank in Frankfurt. \"I don't think the Germans are causing trouble,\" says the Spaniard, referring to the numerous legal complaints by German ECB critics. The Federal Government's economic stimulus package in response to the corona crisis was \"very positive\". And even Bundesbank boss Jens Weidmann, who often crosses over with the southern states in the decision-making bodies of the ECB, receives at least limited praise from de Guindos: \"When I listen to his comments on the Governing Council, I very often agree with his comments. \" Read in the interview why the ECB would still prefer not to respond to the strict warnings of the Federal Constitutional Court - and how de Guindos is resisting the accusation that the central bank is illegally funding the state budgets in southern Europe. SPIEGEL: Señor de Guindos, the ECB is buying bonds from states and companies in the euro zone for 1.35 trillion euros because of the corona pandemic. By doing so, it is pushing their interest rates down and helping countries like Italy to get fresh money cheaply by selling new bonds. That is state financing through the central bank, you argue especially German critics. Right? De Guindos: Government funding is prohibited by the European Treaties, and the ECB's decisions are determined by our mandate to ensure price stability. We are experiencing a severe economic crisis. In the middle scenario, our forecasts predict that economic activity in the euro zone will decrease by almost nine percent in 2020 and that prices will only increase by 0.3 percent. This is significantly lower than our inflation target of just under two percent requires. We are therefore buying more bonds to promote economic growth, achieve our inflation target and prevent the financing conditions in the euro countries from drifting apart and tightening too much. We act exclusively according to the principles of our mandate. Given this sharp decline in economic activity and inflation, we had to act. It is our duty to do what is necessary within our mandate. SPIEGEL: The ECB is currently advising on a new strategy. We have a proposal for you: If you call 0.5 or 1.0 percent as the new inflation target, then you will have almost fulfilled your order and can end the bond purchases. De Guindos: It really won't be that easy. But yes, as part of our strategy review, we'll look at the inflation target. We will listen to diverse societal interest groups, academics and civil society in general. SPIEGEL: Maybe you're measuring inflation incorrectly. Residential real estate has been expensive for years, stock prices have risen, and many people feel that life as a whole is going to be much more expensive than the official data show. De Guindos: Eurostat calculates inflation for the euro area based on data from the individual member countries. This measurement of inflation is adequate. Of course, improvements are always possible and we examine this, for example the possible inclusion of costs for owner-occupied residential property. In our strategy process, we will take very much into account what you are addressing. Unfortunately the pandemic has postponed this work, we are now aiming to present the new strategy in mid-2021. SPIEGEL: If the asset prices for real estate and stocks continue to rise, the rich will become even richer. Those who have little to no wealth are left empty-handed. This increases social inequality. Luis de Guindos has been Vice President of the European Central Bank (ECB) since 2019. The trained economist was previously Minister of Economy in his home country of Spain. He is a member of the conservative Partido Popular party. De Guindos: The best policy against social inequality is to create growth and jobs. Monetary policy has done a lot to achieve this. Please do not forget that, like in 2015 and 2016, we currently have deflationary pressure that we must avert. SPIEGEL: Is it even possible to get out of crisis policy again? The US Federal Reserve tried to do so in late 2018, raised interest rates and panicked global capital markets. De Guindos: The ECB also decided in 2018 to stop buying government bonds on the net. This shows that we can get out if the economic framework allows it. At that time, we had to reissue the program after ten months because of an economic slowdown and falling price pressure. But if the situation improves and the outlook for inflation moves sustainably to a level that is in line with our mandate, we can go back to exit mode. SPIEGEL: Do you really think that this is still possible? The ECB itself says that factors such as aging society and globalization are depressing inflation in the long term. Then you may never reach your inflation target of just under two percent, go on with bond purchases and critics always give you cause to accuse you of implicit government financing. De Guindos: I see no reason why inflation shouldn't go up again. The pandemic is currently depressing global demand and oil prices, and with it consumer prices. Our forecasts are clear: they will remain low for some time. On the other hand, deglobalization and an interruption in the global value chain could also increase inflation. SPIEGEL: Are you committing a violation of the law because you buy much more Italian government bonds than the country's capital key at the ECB? You recently bought around 20 percent Italian paper, but according to the capital key it would only be 14 percent. De Guindos: No, the ECB's capital key continues to be the benchmark for the PEPP purchase program. However, we use the flexibility that it offers us in terms of time, asset classes and origin of the securities. SPIEGEL: What do you mean? De Guindos: It will be settled at the end. We will ensure alignment with the capital key. SPIEGEL: You just need to extend the program again and again and never have to prove that you follow the rules because the final bill never comes. De Guindos: I cannot predict what will happen and therefore cannot rule out extending the program, but we have clearly said that our pandemic buying program is limited and we have determined under the current conditions that the program will end in June 2021 . Until then, we use the flexibility that we have. SPIEGEL: How do you actually explain the boom in the stock markets? After the outbreak of the corona virus in Europe and the USA, the markets collapsed by more than 30 percent, and they have now made up for their losses. How can that be? De Guindos: Two factors could play a role here: The rapid measures taken by the central bank and governments to cushion the economic consequences of the pandemic have increased optimism. In addition, until recently, the view had prevailed that the pandemic was largely under control. All of this has had a positive impact on the stock exchanges. But we also know that markets sometimes overreact, both downwards and upwards. Ultimately, the stock exchanges must remain realistic: At the beginning of the pandemic, we saw sharp price falls on the stock markets. SPIEGEL: So you think that the stock markets will exaggerate and share prices will fall again? De Guindos: I wouldn't say that. That will depend on the evolution of the pandemic. Ultimately, the markets must remain realistic: we are facing a recession in the euro area. SPIEGEL: What is the mood like in the ECB towers? At the last meeting under the old President Mario Draghi in autumn 2019, the massive crack in the Central Bank Council due to Draghi's monetary policy was revealed. The situation now seems more relaxed. Does the pandemic cover up the crack? ECB President Lagarde, Vice de Guindos: \"In general, the degree of agreement is enormous\" De Guindos: It is said that the past has passed. And I think that Mario Draghi's successor Christine Lagarde took office with the intention of listening to everyone. Even in Draghi's day, 99 percent of all decisions were represented unanimously. SPIEGEL: The decisive factor is one percent discrepancy. Like in autumn 2019, when the ECB suddenly started buying government bonds again. And there wasn't even the corona virus. De Guindos: There are always nuances; the Central Bank Council has very knowledgeable people who sometimes vote differently. In general, the degree of agreement is enormous. SPIEGEL: Does that also apply to the Bundesbank chief? The fact is that the federal government is now much more relaxed with money and reacts more pragmatically to the crisis. Do you also notice this new German flexibility at Jens Weidmann? De Guindos: The German stimulus package is very positive. Such programs are the first line of defense to minimize the consequences of the pandemic. And I think that the German government's reaction is correct and that Germany has the financial scope to react quickly and intensively. I believe that a fiscal response is also needed across Europe. It's not just about the scope of the program, it's about the message. A European response makes it very clear that there is an answer from the core and heart of the EU. And that's very important politically. SPIEGEL: We asked about the Bundesbank. De Guindos: I do not comment on the Bundesbank's perspective. The Bundesbank has always taken a cooperative and positive stance and made important and relevant contributions. The Bundesbank is a very, very independent institution. I can assure you of that. SPIEGEL: As independent as the Federal Constitutional Court. This accuses the ECB that its monetary policy is disproportionate and poorly communicated. What now? De Guindos: Our position is clear: we are a European institution and are subject to the jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice and are accountable to the EU Parliament and the European Court of Auditors. We have taken note of the Karlsruhe judgment. Our monetary policy decisions have always been proportionate and appropriate. I assume that the Federal Government and the Bundestag will react to this. We are ready to work with the Bundesbank and provide information to facilitate the answer that the German institutions must give to the Constitutional Court. So we are ready to cooperate, but always with full respect for our independence. SPIEGEL: Means: The Bundesbank has the buck. De Guindos: Well, that's your way of expressing things. Again, we are under the control of the European institutions, but we are open to cooperate with the German institutions. That is the approach. SPIEGEL: Why is it always the Germans who cause trouble? De Guindos: I don't think the Germans are causing trouble. You know, it's the largest country in the euro area. SPIEGEL: But they seem to have the biggest problem with the ECB's monetary policy and, above all, fear inflation more than other Europeans. De Guindos: The inflation rate is well below our target. In addition, Germany's growth rate has been positive in the past ten years, Germany has a very competitive economy, and the favorable euro exchange rate was also positive. So I think that the euro was very beneficial for the German economy and that most Germans recognize this. SPIEGEL: Should Jens Weidmann send out this message more because it apparently receives too little response in Germany? De Guindos: I cannot speak on his behalf. But when I listen to what he says in the Governing Council, I very often agree with his comments. SPIEGEL: Wouldn't it be better if the ECB focused its strategy much more on growth than inflation in the future, if only to end this perpetual cycle of lawsuits against your monetary policy? De Guindos: Our mandate is enshrined in the European Treaties and was decided by the governments and parliaments, we have nothing to say. It is not yet known whether the contracts and the mandate will be changed in the future, but it is certainly not a matter for today. SPIEGEL: As ex-economics minister of Spain, you have to have an opinion on such a question. De Guindos: I had other priorities at the time. We had a difficult time, the recovery of the Spanish economy was very important. So I focused on other topics. SPIEGEL: As the ECB vice-member, you are responsible for financial stability and the banks. Are you sure that banks in the eurozone are strong enough to deal with loan defaults that are sure to come? De Guindos: On average, European banks are much better equipped with capital and liquidity than ten years ago. The problem with European banks is that their profitability was very, very low even before the pandemic. This is clearly reflected in the valuation of the banks on the stock markets. So profitability is the real problem. And I think the pandemic will make this situation worse. European banks' valuations have dropped 30 percent since the crisis began. I think all of this justifies the rapid response of monetary and fiscal policies to the pandemic. SPIEGEL: So what do the banks have to do? De Guindos: Reduce costs, reduce excess capacity and - for some banks - consolidate domestically and across borders. Everything that was previously necessary is now completely inevitable. SPIEGEL: Is it true that the ECB set up a working group to investigate the possibility of a European bad bank? De Guindos: We have decided nothing in this direction. It would be premature to discuss this at the moment.\n",

            " Just over two years after Tengelmann boss and co-owner Karl-Erivan Haub disappeared on a mountain tour in the Swiss Alps, his wife Katrin Haub and her two children achieved an important victory over the family branch of her brother-in-law Christian Haub. The Duisburg district court has upheld its suit against the replacement of a Tengelmann advisory board post. At the end of 2018, a longtime confidante of Karl-Erivan \"Charly\" Haub was removed from the control committee - and replaced by the Duisburg family entrepreneur Franz Markus Haniel. The Charly Haub family took action against this and claimed that this step had only been taken with a two-thirds majority instead of the three-quarters majority they considered necessary. The court agreed. Through the process she is trying, Katrin Haub tries to give herself and her children air in the struggle for influence in the group, which is now mainly led by the Christian Haub tribe - who has become the sole boss. It is uncertain what consequences the not yet final judgment would have on the distribution of power in the family company. (Read more about the family dispute here: Tengelmann's proxy war.) Another sensitive question has been open since Charly Haub's disappearance. How to deal with inheritance tax if one day the missing entrepreneur was declared dead. Because if the two children inherit the father's company shares, inheritance taxes of an estimated 450 million euros are due. So far, the Charly Haubs branch and the group have not been able to agree on who should pay the taxes. A spokesman for Christian Haub had recently said that the aim is still to find a constructive solution that does justice to all sides. The Haub family is one of the richest entrepreneurial families in Germany. Her assets include multi-billion dollar holdings in the Bauhaus chain Obi and the textile discount store KiK. The company is also involved in numerous Internet companies such as Zalando or Delivery Hero. Case number: 22 O 65/19\n",

The interest in naming is particularly high among prominent couples. Singer Katy Perry and actor Orlando Bloom take their time: they only want to decide on a name for their first child after birth. \"We still have to make a concrete decision about her name because I think we have options and she will tell us,\" said Perry on the US radio show \"Karson & Kennedy\". The singer is expecting a girl. She was as excited as you could be to become a mother for the first time in the midst of a global pandemic. She had already experienced \"every feeling under the sun\" during her pregnancy and cited fear, exuberant joy, excessive demands and depression as examples. \"The world is simply in a wild time and it is a wild time to bring life to the world.\" Perry also said that there are \"many rules\" to becoming a parent and that you start sacrificing immediately. \"You start to become a mother or a parent as soon as you are pregnant. Definitely,\" said the 35-year-old. About her fiance Bloom, Perry said he was thrilled to have a little girl. \"They say that little girls are 'Daddys little girls', so it will be, we will see!\" Orlando Bloom, 43, already has a son with Australian model Miranda Kerr: nine-year-old Flynn. It's the first child for Perry. She has had a relationship with Bloom since 2016.\n",

            " The agricultural chemical and pharmaceutical company Bayer in California does not have to point out possible cancer risks from glyphosate. In a Monday ruling, a federal judge in Sacramento granted Bayer and other companies an application not to comply with a state requirement. The background to California's demand was that the WHO cancer research agency IARC classified the weed killer in 2015 - unlike other authorities - as \"probably carcinogenic\" for humans. Bayer disagrees and emphasizes that the products are harmless when used as directed. Judge William Shubb saw the same thing. The U.S. company Monsanto, which Bayer acquired in 2018, and an alliance of other seed manufacturers had obtained an injunction against the regulation in court more than two years ago. However, this decision has so far only been provisional. Now Judge Shubb classified the order of California as illegal - this will probably make the companies permanently avoid warning labels for glyphosate. \"This is a very important judgment for California's agriculture and science, as a federal court, after weighing all the facts, has ruled that the evidence does not support cancer warnings for glyphosate-based products,\" Monsanto said. A statement from California's Attorney General, which Bayer or Monsanto and the other companies faced in the legal dispute, has not yet been received. Bayer acquired the glyphosate problems with the $ 60 billion acquisition of Monsanto, whose key products include Roundup, the weed killer containing glyphosate. After three lost lawsuits and high damages judgments for alleged weed killer risk, tens of thousands of US lawsuits are pending. Bayer takes action against the previous judgments, but is also negotiating a settlement. Analysts estimate that this could cost around ten billion euros. So far, despite longstanding conflicts, science has not been able to conclusively clarify whether glyphosate is carcinogenic or not. Bayer is opposed to the classification of the IARC and other researchers. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) supports the group and, despite the heated debate about glyphosate, has so far maintained that the controversial pesticide poses no health risk to people if used properly.\n",

            " The number of new applications for unemployment benefits continues to rise in the United States. In the week up to and including June 20, 1.48 million people applied for unemployment benefits, the Ministry of Labor said. Although around 60,000 fewer initial applications were received than in the previous week, there can be no talk of a significant decrease. More than 40 million people lost their jobs at least temporarily in mid-March due to the extensive shutdown of the economy to curb the spread of the coronavirus. The number of first-time applications then skyrocketed. At times, more than six million initial applications were recorded within a week. Many shops, factories and restaurants are now allowed to reopen under certain conditions. The more meaningful unemployment rate is only published once a month. After the dramatic slump in the US economy, it fell from 14.7 percent in May to 13.3 percent in May. The unemployment rate for June is released in a week. One reason for the decline in the unemployment rate is likely to be the beginning of an industrial recovery in the USA. Industry recovered significantly in May from the corona-related drop in orders in the previous months. Orders for durable consumer goods such as airplanes or machines rose 15.8 percent compared to the previous month, as the Ministry of Commerce announced. This is the strongest increase in almost six years. Economists had expected an average increase of 10.5 percent. In April, orders had slumped by 18.1 percent in view of the corona crisis, according to revised figures. Without transport goods prone to fluctuations, orders rose by only 4.4 percent in May. However, the demand for transport goods rose by 80.7 percent - after having plummeted in the previous two months. Orders for civil capital goods (excluding the military and aircraft) grew by 2.3 percent. Capital goods are usually considered an indicator of corporate investment activity. \"The data signal that the low of the corona crisis may have passed,\" said Helaba analyst Patrick Boldt. \"Nevertheless, the economic worries remain for the time being because the number of new corona infections is still very high in some regions of the USA.\" The US economy plummeted because of the pandemic. The International Monetary Fund expects gross domestic product to decline by eight percent this year.\n",

            " The union Ver.di has asked the department store chain Galeria Karstadt Kaufhof to forego the planned closure of 20 of Karstadt Sports' 30 stores. It must now be about exhausting all possibilities, chances and ways to get as many jobs as possible, said Ver.di. \"We will do our utmost to preserve the locations and the future of the employees,\" said negotiator Conny Weißbach. Politicians, owners and landlords are now responsible for this. The company had previously announced that, in addition to 62 branches of the department store chain, 20 locations of Karstadt Sports should also be closed. According to the union, \"up to two thirds of the approximately 1200 employees\" are affected. It was not initially known which locations should be closed. The union also recalled the collective agreement that was signed for Karstadt Sports. Among other things, this provides for the adjustment to the tariff level of Galeria Karstadt Kaufhof in two steps by January 1, 2022 as well as securing the location and employment for the remaining houses. \"Specifically, this means an increase in salary for employees affected by job loss to the level of the collective bargaining agreements in the retail sector,\" says Ver.di. From this later the amount of unemployment benefit is calculated. The association of cities and municipalities called for quick support actions for the affected city centers due to the closure of department stores and branches. It needed \"the immediate establishment of round tables,\" said the managing director of the association, Gerd Landsberg, the newspapers of the editorial network Germany. The group and its insolvency administrator would have to develop \"future strategies\" together with the municipalities and the owners of the department store properties. \"This must be about meaningful real estate reuse concepts and the associated strengthening of city centers,\" said Landsberg. The announced closure of 62 department stores means \"a massive clear cut for the cities and regions concerned\". The department stores are \"magnets in the city centers and therefore systemically relevant for the municipalities\".\n",

The stock plunged dramatically, and its place as a Dax-listed company is also at risk. It is about the existence of bank balances in the billions, for which, according to Wirecard's auditors, there is insufficient audit evidence. The company itself filed a complaint against unknown persons - on suspicion of fraud. CEO Markus Braun gave a statement on the company's own YouTube channel on Thursday evening. Markus Braun, CEO of Wirecard AG, has been informed by our auditor EY in Germany that an audit opinion for the annual financial statements for the financial year 2019 requires further audit procedures due to unauthorized bank confirmations. This is due to communications from two banks that manage escrow accounts to the auditor EY. The two banks have changed the management of the trust accounts since they switched to a trustee in 2019. Both banks have an investment grade rating from Moody's or S&P. According to the EY, there are indications that the auditors have been given false confirmations by a trustee or in the area of ​​these banks for fraudulent purposes. The trustee, who has been mandated since 2019, is in constant contact with the banks and Wirecard AG. It is currently unclear why the two banks have told the auditor that the confirmations are fake. The trustee has announced to Wirecard AG that he will clarify the matter at short notice with the two banks that manage the trust accounts. It cannot currently be ruled out that Wirecard AG has become the victim of significant amounts in the event of fraud. If the group does not present a certified financial statement this Friday, there is a risk of the termination of loans amounting to around two billion euros.

            " According to Europol, the corona crisis has resulted in significantly more pictures of rape and sexual exploitation of children being shared online. This emerges from a report published on Friday by the EU police authority in The Hague. According to this, a new record number of cases was found, in particular via peer-to-peer networks for data exchange and on other platforms in the open network. This assessment results from reports to the European police authority, be it from tech companies, child protection organizations or other investigative authorities. The American child protection organization NCMEC is a particularly important partner for investigators. In March alone, around one million cases of recordings circulating on the Internet were reported to Europol by this organization alone. An increase of almost ten times compared to the previous months. NCMEC reports on cases in Germany in March and April, i.e. those months with stricter corona rules, increased by around double and triple compared to the previous year. The numbers fell again in May. NCMEC's ​​numbers are also based on the organization's collaboration with many major tech providers. Companies like Facebook, Microsoft or Dropbox use technology that automatically detects when users upload photos or videos that are already registered in a database as child abuse recordings. The database is fed by investigators who, among other things, store recordings from previous cases. NCMEC only provides numbers for the so-called Surface Web, i.e. the part of the Internet that can be called up regularly in the browser or with mobile apps. The organization cannot provide any figures for the Darknet, in which the data of the users is particularly anonymized. However, Europol investigators have themselves observed an increase in such activities in the darknet. The help hotlines also saw a massive increase in calls in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the previous period, the police said. Europol also warns that there may be an increase in child rape in the corona crisis. However, the data are still too fragmented and incomplete to finally assess this. In their report, the investigators also write that there are fears that child abuse “on order” and in the livestream in the corona situation will increase. Investigators have found that the demand for webcam videos has increased significantly in offender forums. On the one hand, it is about self-recorded abuse that is uploaded or requested. But it is also about recordings of children that would be collected and specially put together by normal websites or social media platforms without their knowledge. During the corona lockdown, children's lives increasingly shifted from the real world to the virtual world, the report said. Perpetrators took advantage of this to enlarge the group of their possible victims. Europol recommends that children and parents pay close attention to which recordings they openly share on social networks. The authority announces more information in the course of its # SayNo campaign.\n",

The illustration of this playing card is even more meaningful than its title: You can see several creatures with pointed hoods, which strongly remind of the outfits of the Ku Klux Klan.

            " \"This card is racist,\" admitted manufacturer Wizards of the Coast in a statement on its website and continued: \"Racism in any form is not acceptable and has no justification in our games or anywhere else.\" In mid-June the company, a subsidiary of the US toy manufacturer Hasbro, removed the \"Invoke Prejudice\" card and six other playing cards from its range. These include \"Crusade\", which gives \"white creatures\" a bonus, and \"Cleanse\", which \"destroys all black creatures\". The pressure on the company had increased in recent weeks after black members of the \"Magic\" community in particular had publicly accused racist grievances in the scene and at the manufacturer. One of them is Lawrence Harmon, longtime podcaster, among others in the \"Magic\" scene. In an open letter he published in early June, he wrote that Wizards of the Coast \"ignores the existence of its black player base\". Harmon further criticized that both the manufacturer and a large part of the community made the black player feel \"not welcome\". In his letter, he classified the manufacturer's public messages on the subject of racism as \"half-hearted platitudes\". Harmon received support from Zaiem Beg, a former employee of Wizards of the Coast. Less than a week later, Beg also published an open letter in which he attested to his former employer that corporate culture was discriminatory. He gives several anonymized examples of cases of inequality within the company that have happened to other People of Color. Beg also criticizes the company's external image as a diverse employer. Management positions are still almost exclusively filled with white employees. In his letter, Beg reports on the pressure that the company exerts on both employees and independent reporters within the scene. Criticism of Wizards of the Coast could \"lead to retaliation, mostly insidious, sometimes open\". To fight back would be like \"career suicide\". The growing louder accusations of racism are not the only problem that Wizards of the Coast is currently facing. The company ended working with longtime playing card designer Noah Bradley on Monday after he was accused of sexual abuse by several women. Numerous users had reported on Twitter about their experiences with sexual abuse in the artist scene, some accused Bradley of sexual assault. The accused then admitted his actions in a tweet. \"Yeah, I was one of those crappy, creepy sexual predators you hear about,\" Bradley wrote, admitting he forced women to have sex.

            " The ski and party location Ischgl offered the corona virus the best conditions at the beginning of March to spread from there to Europe. In the après-ski bars, the celebrants crowded together, dancing, roaring. Tourists then carried the virus to Iceland, Sweden and Germany, among others. A recent study now shows that a large number of people among the Ischgl residents have been infected with the virus - many of them without knowing it beforehand. For the investigation, researchers from the Medical University of Innsbruck called on all residents of the village to be tested for traces of the infection between April 21 and 27 using blood samples and throat swabs. Almost 1500 of the approximately 1600 residents accepted the request. The researchers hardly discovered any active viruses; the outbreak was already under control in April due to the site's lockdown. For this, however, the scientists found in the blood of 42.4 percent of the inhabitants of the village antibodies against the virus, which prove a past infection. In order not to mistakenly attest to an infection with Sars-CoV-2, the researchers checked all results with up to four different tests. In no other place have so many people been proven to be infected with the corona virus, study director Dorothee von Laer, professor of virology at the Medical University of Innsbruck, said at a press conference. It is possible that there are even more cases in hotspots in Brazil or India, but these have not yet been scientifically analyzed and published. Despite the many infections, the value in Ischgl is not sufficient to achieve herd immunity. According to estimates, 60 to 70 percent of the population would have to be immune to the virus. \"Nevertheless, the Ischgl population should be largely protected,\" said von Laer of the result. What is striking in the current investigation is the very high number of unreported cases. Only around 15 percent of the population who had antibodies in their blood knew about their infection beforehand because the pathogen had been detected by a throat swab and a PCR test at the time of the disease. The other 85 percent had previously had no positive corona test. She was surprised that the number of unreported cases was so high, said von Laer at the presentation of the study at a press conference. However, it does not mean that those affected have not felt anything of the disease. Many did not get through the hotline, for example, others dismissed their complaints as a cold. Often, those affected then suffered from scratching their throat or cough for two or three days. The test capacity was still limited in March. According to the researcher, a sure sign of a Sars-CoV-2 infection was the loss of smell and taste. The scientists also encountered antibodies in all participants who described these complaints. According to Laer, there is no question of a stuffy nose through which one can no longer smell. Instead, it is about complaints in which coffee, wine, everything taste the same. These symptoms are very specific to the coronavirus, as they do not occur in the case of flu, for example. The study manuscript is not yet accessible. Unlike many researchers in the Corona period, the scientists decided against making the unpublished raw version accessible on the Internet before it was checked by independent colleagues. Instead, they have submitted the manuscript to a specialist journal and are waiting for this peer review process. However, they informed about the core of the results in advance at a press conference and in a communication. More than 200 children were among those examined for the virus in Ischgl. Their test results confirm previous studies, according to which children infect the pathogen much less frequently than adults. \"Children were about a third less affected,\" said von Laer. While in adults more than 40 percent of the tested antibodies had blood, in children under 18 it was only 27 percent. The reasons for this have not yet been finally researched. For example, it is possible that children are better sealed off. In Ischgl, for example, the age group between 18 and 60 was particularly badly affected - those who often work in tourism and thus have contact with many people. But it is also possible that children are better protected against infection by their immune system. In addition, the results show that the population of Ischgl turned out to be \"tough\" in infections, as described by Laer. There were two deaths from the coronavirus in the place, but few given the number of infections. The danger of the virus, however, is primarily due to the fact that it infects a great number of people extremely quickly without countermeasures, which also drives up deaths. In Ischgl, the coronavirus probably had several weeks to infect more and more people. Von Laer said there are many indications that the pathogen had already spread unnoticed in the second half of February. The lockdown did not take place until mid-March. To confirm this theory, however, samples from February must still be examined for the virus. These are even frozen, for example from tests at the time for other respiratory diseases. In a next step, the researchers want to thaw and examine them. In the future, the Ischgl population could also provide further, important information on how long the antibodies now found will remain in their blood.\n",

Don't miss anything: Subscribe to our Coronavirus newsletter for the latest developments and key background information. 11:23 p.m .: After the appearance of US President Donald Trump in Tulsa, two members of his campaign team tested positive for the corona virus. Both had attended the event, says a spokesman. However, they would have worn masks all the time. Hours before Trump's appearance, his team had announced six positive tests among employees. 10:21 pm: The black-red coalition sees the permanent overcoming of the Corona pandemic and the economic recovery as a central task of the German EU Council Presidency. This emerges from a paper from the coalition leaders after a meeting on Monday evening in the Chancellery, which is available to the German Press Agency. \"With the Covid 19 pandemic, the European Union is facing a fateful challenge,\" says the short decision. Germany will, during its presidency, \"work with all its might to master this task together and in a future-oriented manner and to make Europe strong again\". The \"guiding principles\" of the German Council Presidency, which begins on July 1st, should also be: \"a stronger and more innovative Europe, a just Europe, a sustainable Europe, a Europe of security and common values, a strong Europe in the world\" . The paper does not show what that means in each case. 10:10 p.m .: Immediately before the expected Senate resolutions on further easing in the corona pandemic, Berlin's Governing Mayor Michael Müller (SPD) warned against wasting what has been achieved. The recent outbreaks showed the pitfalls of the virus, he said on Monday night in a speech on RBB television. Already in the previous days, Müller had warned in full-page newspaper advertisements to comply with the Corona regulations. The head of government emphasized that the hygiene and distance rules remained important, especially during the summer months. Mask wearing in buses and trains remains particularly important. \"It is still not the time for carefree celebrations in large groups.\" On TV, Müller expressly thanked \"countless people\" who would have done extraordinary things in the crisis. The Berliners had once again shown solidarity and creativity. \"I have no doubt that we can master this crisis together.\" 9:21 pm: Saudi Arabia restricts the Mecca pilgrimage Hajj due to the coronavirus pandemic. It will be open to a very limited number of citizens and foreigners of all nations living in the Kingdom this year, the state news agency reported on Monday. The background to this is the worldwide increase in Covid 19 cases, the lack of a vaccine and the difficulty in ensuring a sufficient distance for a large number of pilgrims. Saudi Arabia called on Muslims at the end of March to postpone their pilgrimage plans. Around 2.5 million people travel to the Kingdom each year for the pilgrimage. 8:01 p.m .: The number of newly reported deaths due to the coronavirus pandemic in Great Britain on Monday was the lowest since mid-March. This comes from a message from the UK Department of Health. According to this, 15 deaths from people infected with the coronavirus were recorded in the 24 hours to Sunday evening. The number of newly infected people had also been below 1000 for the first time in months. For Tuesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson was expected to announce further easing of the contact restrictions. According to media reports, the minimum distance of two meters should be reduced. Johnson also wants to comment on the possible opening of restaurants and pubs from July 4. 7.48 p.m .: In the United States, the number of coronavirus deaths has risen to more than 120,000. According to Johns Hopkins University, approximately 120,050 deaths were registered by Monday noon (local time). This is by far the highest number of corona deaths worldwide. According to Johns Hopkins University, almost 2.3 million cases of infection have been confirmed in the United States - more than in any other country in the world. 7:20 p.m .: After a further increase in coronavirus cases by a slaughterhouse of the meat company Tönnies, District Administrator Sven-Georg Adenauer considers a lockdown to be conceivable. \"I would say yes,\" said Adenauer on Monday evening when asked whether it \"smelled\" of a lockdown. The mobile teams that are traveling in the apartments and accommodations and also address family members have now entered a certain dark field. \"In this respect, that's a new situation for me,\" said Adenauer. In the meantime, the number of demonstrably infected people continued to increase. There are 1553 positive results from the people who work directly in the plant, said the head of the crisis team in the district of Gütersloh, Thomas Kuhlbusch. A total of 6650 samples were taken. Previously, the authorities reported 1331 confirmed Corona cases (as of Sunday) in the Tönnies workforce. 7:07 p.m .: In Coesfeld district, seven people have contracted Covid-19. The number of people recovered rose by one person to 843 people. The district administrator announced. Meanwhile, workers at the Coesfeld slaughterhouse were tested for coronavirus infections on Friday. In all 528 cases, the result was negative. \"So there was no evidence of infection with the corona virus,\" said the district administrator. At the beginning of May, the coronavirus spread in the Westfleisch company in Coesfeld. The company then had to close. 18:51: The spread of the coronavirus continues: Within a day with 183,000 infections, a new dark record was set, said the head of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, in Geneva. The number of cases worldwide is now 8.8 million. So far, 465,000 people have died of or with Covid-19. Most infections are found in the Americas. The situation in Africa is different, said WHO expert Michael Ryan. Some countries like South Africa would have significant growth rates. But there are also signs that mortality is lower in Africa than elsewhere. 6:23 pm: Due to several new corona infection foci, the Portuguese government is again introducing restrictions in the capital, Lisbon. As Portugal's Prime Minister António Costa announced on Monday, meetings of more than ten people will again be prohibited in Lisbon from Tuesday. Cafes and shops must close at 8 p.m. According to local media reports, over 9,000 new coronavirus infections were registered in Portugal between May 21 and June 21, most of them in Lisbon and neighboring regions. In total, the Portuguese authorities have registered more than 39,000 infections and more than 1,500 deaths from Covid-19 lung disease. 5.48 p.m .: The second phase of easing the corona restrictions has begun in the US metropolis of New York. According to the dpa news agency, offices, hairdressers and shops are allowed to reopen and restaurants are served outside, in compliance with mask, distance and hygiene rules. In addition, brokers, for example, can show their customers apartments and houses on site again. According to the Reuters news agency, the lockdown stretched over a hundred days. Already at the beginning of the first loosening phase two weeks ago, work on the construction sites in the city was allowed. Retailers were able to hand over pre-ordered goods to customers in the store - now public traffic is also permitted in the second phase. Two more opening steps are still pending, each of the four phases is scheduled for two weeks. In New York City alone, according to dpa, more than 390,000 people have been infected with the virus to date, and around 30,000 have died after an infection. 5.10 p.m .: Employees of the meat processor Tönnies in the district of Gütersloh affected by a corona outbreak should not travel to their home countries. They should stay in Germany and could be well looked after in Germany, said North Rhine-Westphalian Minister of Health Karl-Josef Laumann (CDU), according to the Reuters news agency. In order to convince Poles, Romanians or Bulgarians to remain in quarantine, interpreters would also have to be used. The union NGG had previously announced that some employees of the company in the Gütersloh district may have already returned to their countries of origin. \"It can be assumed that some will travel,\" said NGG country chairman Mohamed Boudih. 4:50 pm: In the South African capital province of Gauteng, numerous minibus taxi drivers stopped work on Monday and blocked roads to the cities of Johannesburg and Pretoria. Reuters reports. The drivers are therefore demanding more support from the government in the coronavirus pandemic. People in Soweto, a suburb of Johannesburg, are waiting to be picked up by a shared taxi. According to Reuters, thousands of people were unable to get to work due to the strike. They ran aground at taxi ranks, had to go to work for miles or crowded into crowded buses. Since the start of the Corona regulations in March, minibus drivers have only been allowed to drive at 70 percent capacity, taking into account distance rules. However, according to Reuters, the industry has to drive at maximum capacity to ensure the low fares necessary for many people. South Africa's Minister of Transport recently pledged around $ 250 to help registered taxi operators. 16:35: The federal government has responded to criticism of the lack of compatibility of the Corona warning app with older smartphones. \"Of course one would wish that (...) everyone could work with any old smartphone, but there are technical reasons that cannot be wiped out by the political will of the federal government,\" said government spokesman Steffen Seibert. However, the app runs on \"more than 85 percent of smartphones available in Germany.\" The developers had agreed to check again whether an increase is possible. Almost a week after the launch, Seibert has already downloaded 11.7 million times. Corona warning app However, a download only works if the operating systems of the cell phones are at a certain level. Some devices, such as Apple's older iPhones 4s or 6 Plus, fall through the cracks and cannot install the app at all. (Read more about this here.) What further restricts the use of the app: So far, it can only be downloaded from the German app stores of Apple and Google. Foreign students, employees or travelers are therefore not able to download the app from their home country stores onto their cell phones. 4.20 p.m .: The head of the World Health Organization WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, fears that the corona crisis will have an impact for decades. However, the greatest danger is not the virus itself, \"but the lack of global solidarity and global leadership\". An unsolidated world could not defeat the pandemic: \"None of us are safe unless everyone is safe,\" said Ghebreyesus. According to the WHO chief, the corona pandemic is not only a health crisis, but also an economic and social one, and in many countries also a political crisis. \"Their effects will still be felt in the coming decades.\" According to the Johns Hopkins University, almost nine million infections with Sars-CoV-2 have been confirmed worldwide, around 470,000 people died from the effects of an illness on Covid-19. Coronavirus: Coronaviruses are a family of viruses, which also includes the currently rampant Sars-CoV-2 virus. Since it initially had no name, it was spoken of as a \"new type of corona virus\" in the first few weeks. Sars-CoV-2: The WHO gave the novel corona virus the name \"Sars-CoV-2\" (\"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome\" coronavirus-2). By the term is meant the virus that can cause symptoms but does not have to. Covid-19: The respiratory disease caused by Sars-CoV-2 was named \"Covid-19\" (Coronavirus Disease-2019). Accordingly, Covid-19 patients are people who carry the Sars-CoV-2 virus and show symptoms. 4:00 p.m .: Annalena Baerbock, the leader of the Greens, asked the meat producer Tönnies for comprehensive tests for the virus in the Gütersloh district after the corona outbreak. Only then can it be decided whether strict corona restrictions should be imposed again for the region, said Baerbock. The mass tests should now take place \"immediately\". According to Baerbock, they should ensure that \"the successes of the past few months will not be completely ruined\". Hundreds of people were infected in the meat factory in Rheda-Wiedenbrück in North Rhine-Westphalia, 7000 people have been isolated since then, day care centers and schools are closed. The Greens chief asked the Federal Minister of Agriculture Julia Klöckner (CDU) for a crisis meeting with the relevant ministries from the federal and state governments. The goal must be to agree on \"common standards for all slaughterhouses in Germany\". 3:50 p.m .: For the first time in months, no one in the Netherlands died in one day from the consequences of Covid 19 disease. This was announced by the Institute for Public Health and Environment (RIVM), which is responsible for infectious diseases. So far, 6090 deaths have been registered in the country. The first death in the Netherlands was reported on March 10. On March 31, 175 was the highest number recorded in one day. In total, the virus has been detected in around 50,000 people. 3.20 p.m .: Bulgaria once again obliges its citizens to wear mouth and nose protection in closed communal areas. As Minister of Health Kiril Ananiew announced after a meeting of the Corona crisis team with Prime Minister Boiko Borissow, protective masks must be worn again in shopping malls, shops, cinemas and theaters from June 23. The government in Sofia had opted for greater discipline and lifted the mask requirement in mid-June. However, according to the dpa news agency, the Bulgarians hardly pay attention to the remaining distance and disinfection recommendations. With just under seven million inhabitants, the EU country was able to keep the number of cases below 1,500 by the end of April thanks to the early introduction of corona protective measures, so that the health system remained functional. However, after several festivities and easing of restrictions in May and June, the number of coronavirus cases rose to 3905, particularly in the past week. So far, 199 people have died. 3 p.m .: In England, the opening of the catering trade is getting closer as the corona restrictions are relaxed. According to the dpa news agency, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to discuss this with ministers and scientists behind closed doors on Monday. A possible opening date is already circulating in the British media. As of July 4, pubs, restaurants, hotels and hairdressing shops could reopen under certain conditions. However, easing measures initiated by Johnson only apply to England anyway: each part of the country in Great Britain decides on its own measures in the fight against the pandemic. The Prime Minister had called the closing of the pubs \"exceptional\" as a measure against the pandemic in March. It takes away the \"ancient and inalienable right of free-born people to go to the pub.\" Closed pub in London at 2.45 p.m .: 1. FC Union Berlin faces further trouble after the celebrations to stay in the Bundesliga. \"The Treptow-Köpenick Ordnungsamt is currently examining whether administrative offenses will be initiated,\" the \"Bild\" newspaper quoted a district spokeswoman on Monday. In addition, an announcement by a citizen should have been received by email. Union professionals Christopher Trimmel (33) and Sheraldo Becker (25) and the club itself were fined on Friday. The two players \"had obviously violated general hygiene and infection protection standards after the Bundesliga game against SC Paderborn 07\" and in particular the concept of the German Football League (DFL), the umbrella organization had announced. This can be seen on video recordings, among other things in social networks. They had celebrated the 1-0 win over Paderborn with the fans. The DFL had sentenced the two professionals and the club to a five-digit fine on Friday. The regulatory office could now impose a further fine for an administrative offense, which according to the Infection Protection Act can amount to up to 25,000 euros. 2.10 p.m .: According to a Chinese study, the concentration of an antibody in the blood of coronavirus infections drops sharply after just two to three months. This is reported by the Reuters news agency with reference to the study published on June 18 in the journal \"Nature Medicine\". A total of 37 infected with and 37 infected without symptoms were involved. Accordingly, the concentration of so-called IgG antibodies decreased in some cases by up to 90 percent. On average, a decrease of 70 percent was found in infected with and without symptoms. IgG antibodies mainly work against viruses and bacteria in the body. According to the study, the result also raised doubts about the benefits of immunity passports, as were also discussed in Germany. According to virologist Jin Dong-Yan, who was not involved in the study, other parts of the immune system could still offer protection against the virus. In addition, the number of patients examined in the study was relatively small. 1:55 p.m .: Hamburg's Senator for the Interior, Andy Grote (SPD), apologized for a standing reception he organized despite the corona pandemic. \"At a time when many have to do without a lot due to the strict rules that apply, the impression simply must not arise that the interior senator of all people does not take the rules so strictly,\" said the Grote to the NDR 90 station, 3rd The meeting after his reappointment as a senator almost two weeks ago should not have taken place. \"I sincerely apologize for that, it was a mistake, it mustn't happen.\" However, Grote again emphasized that all the corona rules had been complied with at the reception. The CDU, AfD and FDP had called for Grote's resignation after the incident. 1.40 p.m .: The Bundesbank expects a sharp drop in economic output. The economic stimulus package presented by the coalition parties at the beginning of June should give a boost to the economic recovery and \"could also help to improve the mood of consumers and businesses,\" the bank wrote in its June monthly report. However, the effects of the federal government's multi-billion stimulus package are not yet likely to have an impact in the second quarter. \"However, it is unlikely to have any effect in the second quarter,\" the bank writes. \"Overall, economic output could decline by almost a tenth on average in the current quarter, and thus significantly more than in the first quarter.\" According to calculations by the Federal Statistical Office, Germany's gross domestic product (GDP) shrank by 2.2 percent in the first three months of 2020. As a result, Europe's largest economy plunged into recession - although basically only March affected the virus-fighting restrictions in the first quarter. 12.20 p.m .: Popstars want to collect donations for the development of a vaccine against the corona virus with a concert evening following an international donor conference. The concert with Justin Bieber, Coldplay, Shakira, Miley Cyrus, Usher and Jennifer Hudson is scheduled to take place next Saturday (June 27). Earlier, EU commission chief Ursula von der Leyen campaigned at a donation summit for further contributions from the global community, as the EU commission and the aid movement Global Citizen announced on Monday. \"Artists have the power to inspire change,\" said von der Leyen. It is the second international donor conference that the German politician is organizing. In May, 7.4 billion euros were collected for the search for vaccines and medicines for the coronavirus. At that time, the main speakers were heads of state and government. That should change now. After the regular donation summit with politicians and scientists, but also with artists and activists, the concert follows in the evening. Celebrities such as former soccer professional David Beckham and actresses Salma Hayek, Charlize Theron and Diane Kruger are also expected. The event is to be broadcast worldwide. 11.55 a.m .: There was a second positive Corona case on the Adriatic tour organized by Novak Djokovic, who was ranked first in the world tennis list. After the Bulgarian Grigor Dimitrov, the Croatian professional Borna Coric also announced that he had been tested positive for the corona virus.

He wanted everyone who had been in contact with him in the past few days to take a test. \"I'm fine, I have no symptoms,\" wrote Coric. The Adriatic tour had been canceled after Dimitrov's infection became known on Sunday. However, the tournament had already been criticized before the infections. Spectators sat on the stands without a face mask, tennis professionals had posed with fans for selfies. 11.20 a.m .: As of today, all schools in France are open again, with the exception of secondary schools. As of today, French pupils have to attend, only high school students are exempt. However, the Ministry of Education had signaled understanding for parents who did not want to send their child to class two weeks before the start of the summer vacation. Theoretically, a violation of compulsory schooling is subject to a fine of 750 euros. For the first time in over three months, all stations on the Paris Metro have reopened. In the capital, tourists will also be able to visit the Eiffel Tower again on Wednesday, and Orly Airport is due to open on Friday. Campsites and cinemas can open all over the country. 10:50 am: According to the Reuters news agency, the health authorities in South Korea are talking about a second wave of infections in the country for the first time. You are right in the middle, said Jeong Eun Kyeong, director of the Korean Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC). The KCDC had previously said that the first wave in the country had never really stopped. Now it has become clear that the holiday weekend in early May marks the beginning of the new wave, said Jeong. The infections are mainly detected in the Seoul area. The capital and its surroundings had previously reported only a few infections. \"We originally assumed that the second wave would only come in autumn or winter,\" said Jeong. \"Our prediction turns out to be wrong. As long as people are in close contact with others, we believe that infections will continue.\" 10.10 a.m .: According to an estimate by the Ifo Institute, more than a quarter of those subject to social security in Bavaria are on short-time work. In total, Munich's economic researchers for Bavaria have around 1.47 million short-time workers, which corresponds to 26 percent of those subject to social security contributions. In absolute terms, Bavaria also achieved the highest level in the country comparison and has slightly more short-time workers than the more populous North Rhine-Westphalia. \"Especially in countries with an important automotive and supplier industry, a lot of short-time work is done,\" said Ifo expert Sebastian Link. This should also explain the comparatively high estimated share in Baden-Württemberg and the combined states of Lower Saxony and Bremen (each 23 percent). In North Rhine-Westphalia, Hesse, the combined states of Schleswig-Holstein, Hamburg and Mecklenburg Western Pomerania, and - also combined - in Berlin and Brandenburg, the proportion of short-time workers is 21 percent. In total, the Ifo Institute expects 7.3 million short-time workers in May. It refers to employees who are actually on short-time work. The number of employees for whom short-time work is generally registered is higher. The estimate is based on data from the economic survey conducted by the institute at 9:35 a.m .: After a three-month break, the trains are back on track in Israel. This is reported, among other things, by the dpa news agency. Transport Minister Miri Regev was one of the first travelers. She went by train from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. A video distributed by her ministry showed how she disinfected her hands on a machine before leaving. Railway station in the coastal town of Netanya: rail traffic resumed In addition to hygiene rules and the obligation to wear a mask, further requirements apply on board: tickets must be ordered in advance, no more than 500 passengers may travel on a train and the body temperature is measured before entering the train stations. Rail traffic had been stopped almost three months ago to prevent the virus from spreading further. Israel reacted very quickly with rigorous measures at the beginning of the corona pandemic. In May, the country began to gradually relax. Since then, however, the number of new infections has risen again. According to Johns Hopkins University, around 20,800 people in Israel have been infected with Sars-CoV-2 so far, 306 died from the consequences of an infection. 9.20 a.m .: The hospitals in the European Union are preparing for a further increase in corona infections. \"We need a health army,\" said Maurizio Cecconi of the Reuters news agency. Cecconi is elected president of the European Intensive Care Medicine Society (ESICM) and head of the intensive care unit of a hospital in Milan. \"If there is another big wave, we should be ready to use doctors and nurses from nearby regions of Italy. This was not enough in the first wave,\" said Cecconi. Quick courses are designed to prepare doctors and nurses for another wave. Normally, intensive care patient training would take years, said incumbent ESICM President Josef Kesecioglu. \"We shouldn't wait until the next wave comes,\" said Kesecioglu. \"We should give them regular training.\" 8.55 a.m .: The Thai government hopes to be able to partially lift the entry restrictions for foreigners soon. This was announced by a government spokesman. The easing should apply to business people and skilled workers as well as to foreigners living in Thailand. \"The first three groups should remain in state quarantine after 14 days after their return,\" said the spokesman. Most recently, there had been no transmissions of the corona virus within Thailand for almost a month. 8:40 am: Fear of a second wave of corona infection, several Australian states have warned their citizens against trips to Melbourne. Anyone planning to visit the country's second largest city should rethink this, said New South Wales Prime Minister Gladys Berejiklian in Sydney. The Melbourne authorities have since tightened the corona measures. She advises against traveling to one of Melbourne's six most affected neighborhoods, said Berejiklian. \"We recommend that people only travel to Melbourne at this time if they have to.\" 7.20 a.m .: Prime Minister Winfried Kretschmann (Greens) considers a return to normal operations at the schools in Baden-Württemberg after the summer holidays to be unrealistic. \"Our core problem is the high number of teachers and educators who belong to the vulnerable groups. In schools, that should be up to 20 percent,\" said Kretschmann in an interview with the \"Stuttgarter Zeitung\" and \"Stuttgarter Nachrichten\". \"You can't do normal operations like you did before the corona pandemic.\" 6:50 am: There have been riots in protests against the corona restrictions in the Netherlands. According to the police, officials and mounted water cannons were used against the demonstrators in The Hague on Sunday. Around 400 people were arrested. The demonstrators in the center of The Hague protested, among other things, against the 1.50 meter distance rule. Many of them held hands. The protest initially went peacefully, according to police, until football fans then hurled stones and bottles at the nearby train station against police officers. 6:15 a.m .: EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Council President Charles Michel will join a video conference on Monday (10:00 a.m.) for an exchange with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Li Keqiang. Among other things, the sluggish negotiations on an investment agreement as well as the fight against the coronavirus pandemic and its consequences will be discussed. The EU Commission has been negotiating an investment agreement with China on behalf of the EU member states for more than six years. Among other things, it should improve the access of European companies to the Chinese market and guarantee investment protection. Most recently, the EU had sought an agreement up to the EU-China summit in Leipzig, which was originally planned for September. However, this was recently postponed without specifying a new date - officially because of the corona pandemic. 6 a.m .: During the pandemic, scientists learned a lot about the positive effects of being calmer on the streets. What do we learn from this? 5:25 a.m .: President Klaus Reinhardt advocates a constant crisis buffer at the clinics in view of the coronavirus pandemic. \"Hospitals are not companies in which you can only optimize capacity utilization like in a manufacturing company,\" said the head of the German Medical Association's German Medical Agency. \"We always have to have a certain excess capacity and, of course, also have to finance it in order to be able to react appropriately to crises.\" It is like the fire brigade: \"It costs money, even if it is not in use. But if it burns, it is there quickly.\" Reinhardt said: \"Our health system is working extremely well in the current crisis.\" That applies to both outpatient care and hospitals. \"Therefore, there must be no reduction in capacity or personnel.\" The President of the Physician welcomed the fact that clinics are now once again geared more towards normal care. \"One can assume that a certain backlog of treatment has arisen.\" However, people with other diseases would have the same right to be cared for as Covid 19 patients. \"That's why it's important to rebalance care and encourage patients to actually seek medical help.\" 04.35 Uhr: Vor einem Besuch bei der italienischen Regierung in Rom hat Bundesaußenminister Heiko Maas (SPD) europäische Solidarität in der Coronakrise angemahnt. \"Die Corona-Pandemie hat Italien früher und härter getroffen als andere, aber die Folgen der Krise spüren wir in Europa alle gleichermaßen\", sagte Maas der Düsseldorfer \"Rheinischen Post\" (Montagsausgabe). \"Die wirtschaftliche und soziale Wiederbelebung fordert von uns allen eine Kraftanstrengung, wie sie die Europäische Union noch nie erlebt hat.\" \"Kein Land wird allein den Aufschwung schaffen, wenn der Nachbar in der Krise stecken bleibt, die Nachfrage wegbricht, Lieferketten abreißen\", sagte Maas weiter. Die Krise sei aber auch eine Chance: \"Wenn es uns gelingt, alte Gräben zu überwinden, wenn wir auf den Zusammenhalt und die Solidarität der letzten Wochen aufbauen, dann kann und wird Europa gestärkt aus der Krise hervorgehen.\" Diese Aufgabe werde die anstehende deutsche EU-Ratspräsidentschaft prägen. Maas will am Montag in Rom seinem Amtskollegen Luigi di Maio unter anderem die Schwerpunkte der deutschen Ratspräsidentschaft erläutern, die am 1. Juli beginnt. Zudem besuchen die beiden Minister das italienische Spallanzani-Institut zur Prävention, Diagnose und Behandlung von Infektionskrankheiten. Heiko Maas reist nach Italien Florian Gaertner/photothek.net/ imago images/photothek 04.10 Uhr: In dem vom massenhaften Coronavirus-Ausbruch in Deutschlands größter Fleischfabrik besonders betroffenen Landkreis Gütersloh gehen die Tests am Montag weiter. Once again, mobile teams in cities and municipalities should cut back on household members of Tönnies employees and offer them support. After 32 such teams were deployed on Sunday, their number is to be increased on Monday, said a spokeswoman for the district. The teams involved include employees from the responsible regulatory office, the German Red Cross, the Bundeswehr and interpreters. Local staff are supported by specialist staff from other parts of the country. In the coming days, all other citizens of the district should also have the opportunity to be tested free of charge. After the series tests on the company's premises were completed at the weekend, the remaining findings are expected on Monday. Samples were taken from a total of 6139 employees. 240 results were still pending on Sunday. 1331 infected people have been registered so far. On Sunday, 21 Covid-19 patients were treated in hospital in the four hospitals in the district. Six people were in the intensive care unit, two of whom had to be ventilated.

Hier erklärt er, wie ein Impfstoff gerecht verteilt werden kann. 02.55 Uhr: 7000 Menschen sind bereits isoliert, Kitas und Schulen geschlossen: Der Corona-Ausbruch im nordrhein-westfälischen Rheda-Wiedenbrück beschäftigt die Behörden vor Ort - aber auch die Politik in Berlin. Nach Ansicht von Bundesarbeitsminister Hubertus Heil (SPD) wird der Fleischkonzern Tönnies für Schäden durch den Vorfall haften müssen. \"Es muss eine zivilrechtliche Haftung des Unternehmens geben\", sagte Heil am Sonntag der \"Bild\"-Zeitung. Wer durch Regelverstöße die Verbreitung des Coronavirus auslöse, müsse dafür auch haften. 02.20 Uhr: Bundesgesundheitsminister Jens Spahn (CDU) hat sich für eine umfassende Aufarbeitung der deutschen Corona-Politik ausgesprochen. \"Ich hielte es für eine gute Idee, wenn der Gesundheitsausschuss zusammen mit ausgewiesenen Experten eine große Evaluation erarbeitet, aus der wir für die nächste vergleichbare Situation lernen können\", sagte Spahn den Zeitungen der Neuen Berliner Redaktionsgesellschaft (Montag). Auf die Frage nach einem eigenen Corona-Untersuchungsausschuss, der sich auch mit möglichen Fehlern beschäftigen könnte, sagte Spahn, dies sei \"Sache des Bundestags\". Die Regierung habe stets auf Grundlage des aktuellen Wissensstands entschieden. \"Wir haben jeden Tag dazugelernt. Es gab viel Unbekanntes. Trotzdem müssen Entscheidungen getroffen werden.\" Nicht zu handeln, sei in einer Krise keine gute Alternative. 01.40 Uhr: Lehrer können sich bisher einfach vom Unterricht im Klassenzimmer befreien lassen, wenn sie Angst vor einer Corona-Ansteckung haben. Fast alle Bundesländer führen deshalb jetzt eine Attestpflicht ein. Eine Auswertung des SPIEGEL zeigt, wo wie viele Lehrer fehlen. 01.10 Uhr: Die globale Ausbreitung des Coronavirus beschleunigt sich weiter. Die Weltgesundheitsorganisation (WHO) meldete für Sonntag weltweit 183.020 offizielle Neuinfektionen innerhalb von 24 Stunden. Mehr Neuinfektionen waren zuvor noch nie innerhalb eines Tages gemeldet worden. Der bisherige Höchststand an Neuinfektionen war erst vor wenigen Tagen erreicht worden, am 18. Juni hatte die WHO 181.232 Neuinfektionen gemeldet. Den höchsten Anstieg stellte die WHO in Nord- und Südamerika mit insgesamt 116.000 Neuinfektionen fest. Weltweit haben sich laut WHO-Bericht mehr als 8,7 Millionen Menschen mit dem Virus infiziert, etwa 461.000 Infizierte sind gestorben. 00.15 Uhr: Im stark von der Coronavirus-Pandemie betroffenen Brasilien sind mittlerweile mehr als 50.000 mit dem Virus infizierte Menschen gestorben. Das bestätigte Eduardo Pazuello, der nach dem Abschied von Nelson Teich übergangsweise Gesundheitsminister des Landes ist. Brasilien zählt offiziell 1.085.038 Infizierte und 50.617 Corona-Tote, mehr gibt es nur in den USA. Experten schätzen die Dunkelziffer noch höher ein, weil in Brasilien nicht weitläufig getestet wird. Die US-amerikanische Johns Hopkins University zählte zum Zeitpunkt von Pazuellos Bestätigung noch unter 50.000 Tote in Brasilien. 00.10 Uhr: Nach dem massiven Coronavirus-Ausbruch beim Fleischverarbeiter Tönnies zieht NRW-Ministerpräsident Armin Laschet Kontaktbeschränkungen in Erwägung. \"Wir haben die Schulen und Kitas geschlossen, das ist der erste Teil eines Lockdowns. Und wir werden weitere Schritte in diesen Tagen prüfen\", so Laschet im \"Heute Journal\" des ZDF: \"Ich könnte mir vorstellen, dass wir Kontaktbeschränkungen ebenfalls wieder erlassen, so wie sie im Lockdown gegolten haben.\" Die Zahl der Infizierten in der Fabrik in Rheda-Wiedenbrück im Kreis Gütersloh stieg bis Sonntag nach Angaben des Kreises auf 1331. Bislang haben die Behörden auf einen Lockdown im Kreis Gütersloh verzichtet. Laschet hatte am Sonntag argumentiert, das Infektionsgeschehen sei klar bei der Firma Tönnies lokalisierbar, und es gebe keinen \"signifikanten Übersprung\" hinein in die Bevölkerung.

In den nächsten Tagen werde es einen Bericht von Experten geben, die die Infektionsketten nachverfolgten - der solle abgewartet werden. \"Und ich kann diesen Lockdown nicht ausschließen. Er muss nur gezielt sein, er muss begründet sein, und er muss das Ziel erreichen, dass sich die Infektion nicht weiter in die Bevölkerung verbreitet.\" 00.05 Uhr: Ein prestigeträchtiges Fußballderby mit Tausenden Stadionzuschauern, aber ohne Sieger: Bei einem der europaweit ersten Ligaspiele mit wieder erhöhter Zuschauerkapazität haben sich Bröndby IF und der FC Kopenhagen 1:1 (0:0) getrennt. 3000 Bröndby-Fans konnten dank einer Sondererlaubnis breit verteilt auf den Stadionrängen dabei sein. Zu Problemen bei den durch das Coronavirus bedingten Abstandsregeln kam es dabei offenbar nicht. In Dänemark dürfen bei Veranstaltungen mit bestimmten Sitzplatzkapazitäten mittlerweile wieder bis zu 500 Personen dabei sein. For this matchday, the Copenhagen derby and two other Superleague matches were selected to be kicked off with more than 500 spectators. Aus den Erfahrungen der drei Spiele sollen Erkenntnisse dafür gesammelt werden, inwieweit Fans bei Ligaspielen in Dänemark künftig trotz der Coronavirus-Pandemie auf der Tribüne sitzen können. 0 Uhr: Nachdem der Reproduktionsfaktor in Deutschland bereits am Samstag mit 1,79 deutlich über der kritischen Marke lag, ist er nun erneut sprunghaft angestiegen. Einer Schätzung des Robert Koch-Institut (RKI) zufolge liegt der Wert nun bei 2,88. Der Anstieg sei vor allem auf lokal begrenzte Ausbrüche unter anderem auf einem Schlachthof bei Gütersloh zurückzuführen. Die Zahl der positiven Befunde der Tönnies-Mitarbeiter ist am Sonntag auf 1331 angestiegen. \"Da die Fallzahlen in Deutschland insgesamt auf niedrigem Niveau liegen, beeinflussen diese lokalen Ausbrüche den Wert der Reproduktionszahl relativ stark\", so das RKI. \"Die weitere Entwicklung muss in den nächsten Tagen beobachtet werden, insbesondere in Bezug auf die Frage, ob es auch außerhalb der beschriebenen Ausbrüche zu einem Anstieg der Fallzahlen kommt\", so das RKI. The goal is a value of less than 1, because this reduces the number of infected people. Das ist auch mit Blick auf die Frage wichtig, ob Lockerungen ausgeweitet oder wieder zurückgenommen werden müssten.\n",

            " The immense advances in medicine sometimes make us forget what we don't know. Researchers worldwide are trying to decode the body's immune response to viruses such as Sars-CoV-2 in detail. If the defense reaction against the corona virus could be generated artificially, the sick could recover quickly, and an infection could even be prevented entirely. (You can read more about this here.) In principle, the body always reacts immediately when aggressive foreign bodies enter it: The immune system quickly sets up antibodies. These antibodies dock onto the disease-causing agents and thereby switch them off. Thanks to this body's own defense, most infections with the novel coronavirus Sars-CoV-2 develop with only mild or even no symptoms. Depending on the course of the infection, the body reacts with various antibodies. So-called IgM antibodies begin, which can usually attack several pathogens, but in many cases do less. This is followed by IgA antibodies and finally the IgG antibodies, which are also active for a long time. However, they can only be reliably detected weeks after infection. According to preliminary study results from researchers at the University Hospital Zurich, the immune response could help decide how severe Covid-19 disease is. For the study, the scientists examined more than 160 people who had come into contact with the coronavirus and subsequently developed severe, mild or no symptoms. In the case of mild or asymptomatic courses, IgA antibodies could be detected in the tear fluid or in the nasal mucosa. However, no IgG antibodies were found in the blood serum. One possible explanation: IgA antibodies, which lurk in the mucous membranes of possible intruders, were able to successfully ward off the virus before it spread throughout the body. This did not force the immune system to use harder guns to get rid of the pathogen, such as a fever or cough. The cases were mild or without any symptoms. In return, however, the concentration of IgG antibodies in the blood did not increase. Initial study results from Lübeck also suggest that not all patients with mild symptoms form antibodies. In 30 percent of 110 infected people with mild or no symptoms, no antibodies could be detected that would indicate infection with the novel corona virus. It is unclear whether those affected are still protected from re-infection. On the one hand, her body was already able to fight off the virus. This suggests that the IgA antibodies, which are found mainly in the mucous membranes of younger people, offer some protection. However, other studies indicate that the number of viruses that someone comes into contact with determines the further course of the infection. If someone gets a particularly large number of viruses, for example because someone sneezes in his face in the elevator, the risk of a serious illness increases. Experts nevertheless assume that immunity exists for a certain time even with asymptomatic courses. In fact, other analyzes have also shown that IgG antibodies in the blood of asymptomatically infected people indicate possible immunity. However, their concentrations dropped again within two to three months after the infection, Chinese researchers recently reported in the journal \"Nature Medicine\". This also applied to patients with severe symptoms. However, whether this means that those affected can become infected again after a few months is unclear. Other mechanisms of the immune system that could ward off a pathogen once recognized probably play a role in the defense. In addition, the study results were based on data from 74 patients only. So far, no case is known in which a person who has been diagnosed with Covid 19 has infected with the coronavirus only a few months after the infection. Because memory cells of the immune system can obviously remember how the virus can be fended off in the event of a second infection. However, the analyzes question the reliability of antibody tests. Several antibody mass tests are planned in Germany to reveal the number of unreported infections. If it should be confirmed, however, that not all of the infected persons are producing the desired antibodies or that the number of antibodies is so low within a few months that they can no longer be detected, such tests could not reliably detect all infected persons afterwards. This could also mean that immunity passes, which health minister Jens Spahn brought into play, would not be very meaningful. Their idea: Anyone who can show positive antibody detection can afford greater freedom because they are likely to be unable to infect anyone. However, the analyzes from Switzerland, Germany and China suggest that the antibodies to which the tests respond are not floating in everyone's blood. Even if they have already had an infection with the coronavirus. \"Taken together, our data show the risk associated with the use of such immunity cards,\" the researchers write in the \"Nature Medicine\" study. \"This speaks for the need to extend public health policies, such as social distance, isolation of high-risk groups and widespread testing.\"\n",

            " The Japanese company Fujitsu has developed a technology that can check compliance with the hygiene requirements for hand washing. With the help of artificial intelligence (AI), the system should be able to recognize whether someone has been washing their hands long enough, between the fingers, around the wrist and also under the fingernails. In their tests, the developers followed the recommendations of the WHO and the Japanese Ministry of Health. The system consists of a camera that records how someone washes their hands over a sink and software that analyzes the video recordings. Senior Fujitsu researcher Genta Suzuki demonstrated the system this week in the company's laboratories in Kawasaki. \"Those in the food industry and other industries affected by the corona crisis, to whom we demonstrated the system, would love to use it,\" said Suzuki. You have already received inquiries about the price. However, Fujitsu has not yet decided whether the AI ​​technology should also be offered on the market, said Suzuki. If the system is satisfied, it shows \"good\". Prior to this, six different steps recommended by the WHO for hand washing are checked. According to the company, the system should also be able to determine whether someone is using soap or not. Technically, this detection was a challenge because it made the detection points in digital image analysis less clear, according to a press release from the company with further technical backgrounds. But with the help of two newly developed deep learning algorithms, the problems were under control and hand movements could also be reliably recognized during washing. According to Fujitsu, the AI ​​system was trained with around 2000 different recorded situations. Different sinks, types of soap, people and camera positions should not be a problem. The tests were carried out by Fujitsu employees in Japan, but also by other test persons outside of Japan who were paid for it. The system is based on a technology called \"Actlyzer\". Fujitsu had already developed this before the corona crisis. Among other things, it was originally intended to help identify crimes and detect suspicious physical activity. However, the system could not identify people by their hands. However, it can be coupled with other identity recognition systems so that companies can check whether their employees wash their hands thoroughly enough, explains Fujitsu researcher Suzuki. If desired, the system can also be programmed so that it automatically plays the song \"Happy Birthday\" or other music to accompany hand washing. The World Health Organization recommends singing the song \"Happy Birthday\" twice while washing hands. So you would wash your hands for 30 seconds, which is ideal for hand hygiene.\n",

            " The anger of the head of the crisis team, Thomas Kuhlbusch, can be seen: \"The trust that we place in Tönnies is zero. I have to say that so clearly\". It had become known a few days ago that a corona outbreak had occurred among the employees of the largest German slaughterhouse in Tönnies near Rheda-Wiedenbrück. Since Friday, all 7,000 employees - including CEO Clemens Tönnies - have been in quarantine. Measures on site are supported by soldiers of the Bundeswehr - but the cooperation between Tönnies is obviously inadequate. The company has been reluctant to provide employee addresses, the head of the crisis team criticized. \"We got address lists, there were thirty percent of the employees without an address. At some point, people say that they leave work,\" said Kuhlbusch. Finally, the district of Gütersloh, together with occupational health and safety, obtained access to the data on Friday evening. \"We were at the Tönnies company last night at 9:00 p.m. and finished at 1:30 a.m. tonight. Then we had the complete address lists,\" said Kuhlbusch. Earlier, District Administrator Sven-Georg Adenauer had informed that the Tönnies company had \"not managed\" to provide addresses of the employees employed by subcontractors. After the district of Gütersloh had gained access to the personnel lists, there are now around 1,300 addresses where Tönnies employees live. \"We work with mobile teams in the Gütersloh district. Visit the apartments, look at the living conditions, make compromises, inform the people who live there about quarantine,\" said Adenauer. Neither Head of Crisis Staff Kuhlbusch nor District Administrator Adenauer was able to hide their anger at the meat producer. When asked why there was no representative of the company at the press conference, Kuhlbusch said: \"We do not need any of the Tönnies company for this event. We have the agenda here.\" The Tönnies company would have had weeks to explain itself beforehand. There have also been warnings about a possible corona outbreak for a long time. \"The more compact the working conditions, the thinner the ice. Here the ice is broken,\" Kuhlbusch criticized the company. \"I say very clearly: control is better than trust,\" said the crisis team leader. You will not trust blindly. He was happy that \"the dark field of staff accommodation could be brightened.\" In addition to the clear criticism of the company, there was also positive news. \"We now have 3127 results, of which 1029 are positive. Yesterday we had 830 positives,\" said District Administrator Adenauer. The proportion of positive tests has decreased significantly. There is also no significant entry of corona cases into the general population. \"We still have the chance to prevent a lockdown for the district and for the region,\" said Adenauer. The results of the findings now suggest that a hotspot of the corona outbreak in the area of ​​the decomposition had arisen. \"Around two thirds of the employees were infected during the cutting process, which is a shockingly high figure,\" said Kuhlbusch. The low temperatures and cramped working conditions in this area may have contributed to an outbreak. In other areas of the slaughterhouse, the number of infected is significantly lower. \"We now have around 200 more cases, although we evaluated significantly more findings,\" said Kuhlbusch. The infection focus has a clear core. \"Based on the hotspot, we are looking at the extent to which the spread of the infection spreads within the company. We hope that the further we get from the hotspot, the lower the numbers will be,\" said Kuhlbusch. According to District Administrator Adenauer, the top priority now is to \"contain the spread and prevent a shutdown.\" It was announced on Wednesday that an outbreak with a large number of people infected with corona had occurred among the employees of the largest German slaughterhouse in Tönnies near Rheda-Wiedenbrück. A corona outbreak had already occurred in May at a Westfleisch slaughterhouse in the Coesfeld district.\n",

            " Ex-Wirecard boss Markus Braun sold a large part of his shares in the Dax group, which was threatened by a balance sheet scandal. In a series of sales, Braun generated a total of 155 million euros on Thursday and Friday, as Wirecard announced in several ad hoc notices this Tuesday evening. Braun, who was suspected as an accomplice in the balance sheet scandal, was also the largest Wirecard shareholder with a stake of seven percent. The Dax group has a total of almost 123.6 million shares in circulation, Braun has now sold more than five million of its 8.7 million Wirecard papers. The Wirecard papers have lost over ten billion euros in value since Wednesday evening. Braun itself should have made the price losses poor by over half a billion euros - at least on paper. The triggers were so-called \"margin calls\", a means with which brokers can force investors to limit losses. According to reports by the \"Financial Times\" and the US financial news agency Bloomberg, Braun had financed part of its equity interest with loans and deposited the papers as collateral. Braun resigned last Friday because of the balance sheet scandal of alleged air bookings in the amount of 1.9 billion euros, the Munich public prosecutor had arrested him on Monday evening. The Munich district court has suspended the arrest warrant for high conditions. Braun has to pay a deposit of five million euros and report to the police every week.\n",

            " Entrepreneur Clemens Tönnies has rejected speculation about his resignation after the massive Corona outbreak in one of his slaughterhouses. \"I will lead this company out of this crisis,\" said the 64-year-old at a press conference in Rheda-Wiedenbrück. He added: \"And then we'll see. I don't leave the dust.\" In a dispute about Germany's largest slaughterhouse, which had been going on for years, Robert Tönnies had previously asked his uncle Clemens to clear the way. His son Max Tönnies should take over the work in the management. Robert Tönnies also called for an extraordinary general meeting to be called. At the press conference, however, Clemens Tönnies admitted that there could be no going on. He promised: \"We will change this industry. Not only because of this epidemic.\" Co-CEO Andres Ruff said they would do anything to \"protect the population.\" Clemens Tönnies now wants to do everything possible to contain the outbreak. \"I am responsible,\" continued the 64-year-old. Clemens Tönnies rejected allegations by the district of Gütersloh that it had been uncooperative when it came to finding employees' home addresses. \"We have privacy issues,\" he said. According to contract law, the company should not save the addresses of the workers concerned. Co-CEO Andreas Ruff added: \"We immediately passed on all the data we had to the authorities.\" The relationship between the Gütersloh district in which the location concerned is located and the Tönnies company has meanwhile broken. \"The trust that we place in Tönnies is zero. I have to say that so clearly,\" said Thomas Kuhlbusch, head of the crisis management team. The head of the Health Department at the district also reported that Tönnies had delivered lists of employees by Friday, for whom 30 percent had no addresses. The company was slow to respond to inquiries, and operations were closed on Saturday for 14 days, at which point 1,029 employees had tested positive for the virus.\n",

            " Because of the Corona pandemic, many people were unable to go on vacation, to business meetings or to friends and relatives. At Lufthansa, numerous customers are still waiting for tickets for the canceled flights to be reimbursed - the payment of around one billion euros is still outstanding, said Human Resources and Legal Director Michael Niggemann at the extraordinary general meeting. The teams have been strengthened to deal with the inquiries and around one billion euros have already been paid out. Under EU law, airlines are required to reimburse the ticket price for flights canceled by them within seven days. Consumer advocates had recently accused the airlines of breaking the law because the payouts often drag on. Lufthansa boss Carsten Spohr announced that the traffic jam should be cleared in six weeks. Considerable cash would flow away for this in the coming quarter. The prerequisite, however, was the acceptance of the state rescue package by the shareholders, which was still outstanding in the early evening. The rescue plan for Lufthansa stipulates that the state should join the stricken airline. Specifically, the State Economic Stabilization Fund (WSF) is to subscribe to shares in the course of a capital increase in order to build up a 20 percent stake in the airline's share capital. In addition, silent deposits totaling up to EUR 5.7 billion and a loan of up to EUR 3 billion are planned. However, the latter is not subject to the requirements and was basically approved in March. Shortly before the Lufthansa shareholders' decision to enter the state, Federal Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) once again advertised the federal government's offer. \"There is a good offer on the table and Lufthansa shareholders should accept it,\" said Scholz. The federal government is offering support to Lufthansa and its more than 100,000 employees \"in an unprecedented emergency\", the aid package is at the same time \"the legitimate interests of taxpayers.\" The prospect of aid is a thorn in the side of rival Ryanair. The company, which is Europe's largest low-cost airline, therefore wants to go to the European Court of Justice. \"This is a spectacular case in which a rich EU member state ignores EU treaties for the benefit of its national industry and to the disadvantage of poorer countries,\" said Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary. The EU Commission's competition authorities had previously approved the federal government's Lufthansa rescue package. O'Leary said that under the pretext of the corona crisis, the federal government is granting Lufthansa a bailout package of nine billion euros. This is a \"clear break\" of the competition rules. Smaller competitors would be pushed out of the market. The Ryanair boss called on the EU Commission to stand by its principles and to be fair. \"If not, the single market that the EU has successfully built will collapse and European consumers and taxpayers will pay the price.\" The Commission's approval of the Lufthansa rescue package was a \"betrayal\" of the basic principles of EU law. Ryanair \"has no choice but to contact the EU court\".\n",

            " The management believes that the closure of more than a third of the Galeria Karstadt Kaufhof branches is the only way to save the company. \"We know what this means for the employees concerned. But this step is without an alternative, because these branches endanger the overall existence of the company,\" said the general representative Arndt Geiwitz on Friday. Ultimately, it is about securing the company and many thousands of jobs. The group plans to \"close 62 out of 172 branches and two so-called bargain centers\". Given the effects of the corona crisis, she no longer has an economic perspective, said Geiwitz. As a result of the closure and further cost-cutting measures, at least 5,000 of the 28,000 jobs at the group are likely to be lost. The Group's General Works Council reported exactly 5,317 people who would lose their jobs - and spoke of the darkest day for the workforce. There is \"a feeling of powerlessness\". There is fear of \"what triggers the cruel news among our colleagues\". The employee representatives also criticized the landlords of the department stores: they would avoid their social responsibility. Among other things, a rally is planned in Hamburg on Saturday. However, the number of store closures overall is somewhat lower than initially feared. Originally, the management had even signaled that up to 80 branches were on the brink of refurbishment for the struggling company. SPIEGEL has learned from informed circles which branches are being closed. See here which branches will be closed soon: The company, the general works council and Ver.di only agreed on a social plan and a reconciliation of interests on Thursday evening. The agreement also includes a transfer company for employees who have to leave the company. Plenipotentiary Geiwitz spoke of a \"painful cut\". In addition, collective agreements were made for the employees who remain in the company. The court-appointed administrator Frank Kebekus welcomed the agreement with the employees. Now, however, a satisfactory solution had to be found \"promptly\" with the landlords. Federal Minister of Labor Hubertus Heil asked the parties on Friday to refrain from layoffs when restructuring the company. \"I expect that there will be no sweeping cut plans on the back of the workers,\" said the SPD politician. In addition, future concepts should be designed for the branches threatened by the closure. Owners and creditors are obliged not to pursue \"radical layoff plans\", but to invest in the preservation of jobs and the future viability of the company. \"In the event of personnel adjustment measures, I expect a corresponding social plan to be agreed.\" The pandemic closing of all branches had brought the retail group into a serious crisis and had to seek rescue in a protective shield procedure in early April. Galeria Karstadt Kaufhof expects the pandemic and the economic downturn that it triggered to lead to a loss in sales of up to 1.4 billion euros by the end of 2022. The closure of the branches should also cause unrest in many municipalities. Norbert Portz from the German Association of Cities and Towns warned of the danger of desolation of many inner cities as soon as the first closure plans became known in May. \"Galeria Karstadt Kaufhof is not just anyone. The department stores are systemically important for many city centers,\" he said. For many structurally weaker inner cities in particular, a loss of department stores can hardly be compensated for. At that time, Ver.di warned that a wave of closings at Galeria Karstadt Kaufhof would have an impact far beyond the company. In the medium term, this would also threaten tens of thousands of jobs at other retailers and the attractiveness of entire city centers.\n",

            " The sell-off of Wirecard shares continues. The papers of the payment service provider, which was hit by a serious balance sheet scandal, lost another 38 percent in early trading to 15.10 euros, after having plummeted by up to 82 percent on Thursday and Friday. The stock market value has shrunk to just under 1.9 billion euros, which means that eleven billion euros have vanished into thin air since Wednesday. Significantly, 1.9 billion euros is also the sum that the group misses. In the balance sheet scandal, Wirecard had to admit that the bank balance allegedly held in escrow accounts \"with a predominant probability does not exist\". There is a billions of fraud in the room. There is caution on the stock market. \"Nobody wants to reach into the falling knife,\" said a trader. \"The future of the company is currently more than uncertain.\" There should also be a wave of lawsuits. Wirecard processes cashless payments for merchants, both at cash registers and online. The company has been in trouble for over a year since the London Financial Times accused management of a series of accounting manipulations in a series of articles. Financial supervision Bafin and the Munich public prosecutor are also investigating the Wirecard case. According to the current information on possible air bookings in the billions, Wirecard could be investigated further. \"We are investigating all possible criminal offenses,\" said a spokeswoman for the Munich I public prosecutor's office. After EY's auditors had refused to approve the annual accounts because of the lack of funds, Wirecard banks could now terminate the loans. In addition, Wirecard subsequently not only reduced its preliminary estimate for the 2019 financial year, but also the figures for the first quarter. Possible effects on the annual financial statements of previous financial years are also not excluded. The rating agency Moody's already lowered its rating for Wirecard's creditworthiness to \"Ramsch\" late on Friday evening and announced that further gradings were possible. Nevertheless, the banks could continue to stand by the group for the time being: \"Nobody is interested in canceling the loan,\" quoted the \"Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung\" from one of the participating banks. \"Everyone now wants to stabilize the thing in the short term.\" Interim chief James Freis is also fighting for the survival of the group: with the help of investment bank Houlihan Lokey, who was hired on Friday, they are still in \"constructive talks\" with the lending banks. According to the report, the Wirecard community said it was hoped for an agreement by the end of next week. Wirecard had previously assumed that the escrow accounts existed and had shown them as an asset - and had to admit that the money was probably gone: \"Possible effects on the financial statements of previous financial years cannot be excluded.\" The Wirecard balance sheet scandal had worsened dramatically in the past week. The controversial CEO Markus Braun had to vacate his post. On Friday, the Philippine banks BDO Unibank and Bank of the Philippine Islands announced that the German Dax group was not a client with them. Documents from external auditors that said the opposite were forged. The total should have been in the accounts of the two banks.

            " Spain has re-opened its borders to European travelers after more than three months. During the night of Sunday, the country lifted the state of emergency imposed on March 14 due to the corona crisis and reopened its land border with France and its ports and airports for people from the European Union. The border with Portugal will remain closed until July 1st. People from the EU and Schengen countries no longer have to go into a two-week quarantine when entering the country. Around 600 officials from the Ministry of Health will measure the temperature at airports for travelers arriving from abroad. The Spaniards are also allowed to travel in their own country again. However, Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez warned a few hours before the border opened that Spain is still vulnerable to the virus and that protective measures must continue to be followed. \"We have to be on guard and strictly follow hygiene and protective measures,\" Sanchez said in a television speech on Saturday. With more than 28,000 corona deaths, Spain is one of the countries most affected by the pandemic in Europe.\n",

            " According to a study by the Bertelsmann Stiftung, progress has been made in the learning of pupils with and without disabilities. This is shown by calculations based on data from the Conference of Ministers of Education. According to this, 43 percent of children and young people with special needs in grades one to ten were taught in general schools in the past school year. 57 percent went to special schools. Ten years earlier, only 19 percent of those affected had learned together with other students in general schools, 81 percent had attended special schools. However, the number of students with special needs rose from around 472,000 to just under 545,000 during this time, while the total number of students in the above-mentioned grades fell from just under 8 to 7.4 million. If you look at all pupils in Germany and calculate the proportion of children from grades one to ten who were taught at special schools, there has been little movement in terms of inclusion in the past ten years. In the school year 2008/09 the proportion of pupils who went to special schools was 4.8 percent. In the school year 2018/2019, the so-called exclusion rate was still 4.2 percent. For the school year 2030/2031, the study makers forecast a stagnation in the proportion of students at special schools at 4.2 percent. Nicole Hollenbach-Biele, co-author of the study, \"still sees a strong tendency to transfer pupils from primary and secondary schools to a special needs school\". Germany is generally lagging behind when it comes to approximating the requirements of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Germany ratified the convention in 2009 and thus also agreed to the passage that people should not be excluded from the general education system because of a disability. In a survey carried out for the study of parents of school-age children up to the age of 16, almost all respondents (94 percent) advocated joint learning between children and adolescents with and without physical impairment. There was also high approval rating for the inclusion of students with language or learning difficulties (71 percent). According to the information, the inclusion of children with intellectual disabilities or with behavioral problems in the emotional-social area did not find a majority in the parents' opinion, with only 48 and 37 percent of the respondents in favor of teaching together. Nevertheless, Bertelsmann board member Jörg Dräger sees a generally positive mood with regard to school inclusion. \"Politicians should take advantage of this tailwind and show significantly more courage for inclusion in the next few years,\" says Dräger. The parents' positive attitude coincides with the research results. Accordingly, pupils with special needs benefited from the joint lessons, while the other pupils were not able to discern any technical disadvantages. They also benefited socially.\n",

            " SPIEGEL: Mr. Antinori, you have worked for Lufthansa for more than a dozen years, including as a member of the board for sales, product and marketing. Now the airline is in the worst crisis in its history. How do you see the situation at your former employer? Antinori: I often think of Lufthansa these days and could not have imagined what was happening there. That's why I'm sad about the situation and, above all, I'm sorry for the workers because they are a large community. But I'm optimistic. Life is always fair in the end. This will also be shown at Lufthansa. Rüdiger Wölk / imago images Thierry Antinori, 58, started his career in the management of Air France and was then a board member at Lufthansa for many years. After a position as sales director at the Arab airline Emirates, he is now strategy director in Doha at the state airline Qatar Airways. SPIEGEL: When you started at the company in 1997, the Lufthansa managers were happy that they had just gotten rid of the state as a major shareholder. Now the federal government should start again. What was the mood like back then? Antinori: 1997 was a great year for Lufthansa. First the privatization was celebrated, then the formation of the Star Alliance with Lufthansa as a founding member. The decade began with the rise of Lufthansa to become the leading European airline. I felt honored to be part of this development. Now she was suddenly interrupted. SPIEGEL: Lufthansa is not the only airline that has been hard hit by the corona crisis. What is the situation like at your new employer Qatar Airways? Antinori: The cake that has to be distributed, i.e. the remaining business, has become significantly smaller for everyone. At Qatar Airways we said on March 12, 2020: Don't panic, let's judge that. When an alarm sounds in an aircraft cockpit, the pilots initially do nothing, at least for 30 seconds. The hands belong under the bottom. You don't react too quickly, we did that in Qatar. We analyzed the situation and the market, looked at our own strengths and found that we are the toughest and most resilient airline on the market. Since the illegal blockade of Qatar by neighboring countries in 2017, we have shown that our airline can master difficult situations ... SPIEGEL: ... the states accuse Qatar of supporting terrorist groups and therefore block their own airspace for the Qatar Airways jets imposed. Many thought your airline would not survive. Antinori: But we held our own. Between 2017 and today, we grew 35 percent despite losing 18 overnight routes and losing access to four key markets. This stress resistance helps us decisively in the corona crisis. During the corona crisis, we quickly realized that there was a need to fly people from certain countries, such as from Asia or Australia, to bring them back home and bring families back together. Despite the crisis, we flew continuously every day and never offered less than 28 destinations a week. We even flew to certain locations such as Frankfurt, London, Paris or Amsterdam on a daily basis. We even continued daily flight operations on several routes, for example to Frankfurt. There has not been a single day since the Corona eruption that a Qatar Airways plane was not in Frankfurt. SPIEGEL: The machines to Frankfurt or Munich were certainly half empty, weren't they? Antinori: Not necessarily. There were just a lot of guests with one-way tickets on board. The flights from Australia to Doha, for example, were full, and those from Doha to Frankfurt, too. However, there were fewer bookings on the routes from Frankfurt or on the way to Australia. We flew east for a few days with an occupancy rate of less than ten percent. It is more important for us to fulfill our mission and to be the most reliable airline by not canceling flights and not disappointing our customers. SPIEGEL: Arab and Asian airlines in particular are putting a lot of effort into the hygiene precautions on the plane. How do they look at you? Antinori: We own five percent of the Chinese airline China Southern. We were able to learn a lot there, because you were simply affected there earlier. We learned a lot from ourselves: temperature measurements, for example. Or full body protective suits - they may not be very fashionable, but they do help. We disinfect our jets with ultraviolet light, which is even more effective than the mere use of disinfectants. SPIEGEL: Industry experts assume that short and medium-haul traffic will recover faster than intercontinental traffic. However, the golf airlines in particular specialize in long distances. Will airlines have to merge? Antinori: I have no idea what our competitors want to do. But we don't have to, we are strong and we have a good fleet. Well, the homecoming flights are over now. And it has become more complicated to find routes with enough demand, but they do exist. There are always countries to which you can fly again, for example to the USA, to New York. We have been flying there again for a few days. The first flight from Doha had an occupancy rate of 93 percent. We also have the largest cargo fleet in the world with 28 cargo aircraft. It is going well. If you take a lot of freight with you on passenger flights, you can also fly profitably with less capacity. SPIEGEL: You only increased your stake in the British Airways and Iberia parent company IAG to 25.1 percent shortly before the corona crisis. In addition, you each hold a ten percent stake in Cathay Pacific and the Chilean company Latam. The latter just had to file for bankruptcy, but plans to continue flying. Do you want to continue buying minority stakes in other airlines? Antinori: Yes, that was our strategy even before the crisis: investing in other quality airlines that operate in different parts of the world. We will continue to do so. SPIEGEL: Your supervisor, Qatar Airways boss Akbar Al Baker, also wanted to join Lufthansa last December. Carsten Spohr, the Lufthansa boss, brusquely rejected it at the time, arguing that there was no desire to go back under the influence of the state on the detour via Qatar Airways. Are the chances better today? After all, Lufthansa needs help. Antinori: You have to ask Akbar Al Baker. In the end, he makes the decisions with senior management, and I am sure that at this point in time he read Mr. Spohr's answer very carefully. SPIEGEL: From July 1, you want to fly to Berlin again and switch from Tegel to the new BER airport. Do you really think it will open on time? Antinori: We talked about BER airport when I was with Lufthansa. That was long ago. But this time I have a good feeling. We are looking forward to the new airport. It will be the most modern airport in Germany, maybe even Europe. Doha is the most modern airport in our region. That fits together perfectly, Qatar Airways will be there with its known reliability.\n",

            " Even more than half a year after the novel coronavirus Sars-CoV-2 became known, researchers still do not know exactly what role children play in the spread of the pathogen. There are two factors to consider: how often children get infected and how contagious they are. Researchers headed by the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, among others, are currently trying to get an answer to the first question. To this end, they have been testing 6000 children and adolescents up to the age of 18 for an infection with the corona virus and for antibodies against it since May 11. So you check how many children and adolescents are acutely infected with the corona virus and how many have previously had an infection with the pathogen. Now they have presented the first, preliminary interim results. Ania Muntau, director of the Clinic for Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine at UKE, reported at a press conference that around 3636 children and adolescents from Hamburg who had previously had their blood drawn had 36 antibodies against the new virus in their blood. It is striking that the likelihood of experiencing an infection increased with age. Children and adolescents, for whom antibodies were found, were on average 9.7 years old. Subjects who had no antibodies in the blood were on average 7.9 years old, i.e. significantly younger. The team found the least frequently in the age group up to six years - with a share of 0.47 percent. Among the six to twelve year olds, 1.47 percent tested positive, and among the twelve to eighteen year olds, 1.9 percent had developed antibodies, so they had come into contact with the virus before. \"These values ​​are highly significant,\" said Muntau. So they cannot have been created by the random composition of the sample. However, the doctor points out that the results could change somewhat once all 6000 children and adolescents have been examined. The evaluation is only final when it has been assessed by colleagues and published in a specialist journal. There are different interpretations of where the determined age differences come from. One reason could be that younger children are not so easily infected with the new corona virus. Another explanation is that they have a smaller contact radius than older children, so fewer opportunities to get infected. That was not only the case in lockdown, but also. Coronavirus: Coronaviruses are a family of viruses, which also includes the currently rampant Sars-CoV-2 virus. Since it initially had no name, it was spoken of as a \"new type of corona virus\" in the first few weeks. Sars-CoV-2: The WHO gave the novel corona virus the name \"Sars-CoV-2\" (\"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome\" coronavirus-2). By the term is meant the virus that can cause symptoms but does not have to. Covid-19: The respiratory disease caused by Sars-CoV-2 was named \"Covid-19\" (Coronavirus Disease-2019). Accordingly, Covid-19 patients are people who carry the Sars-CoV-2 virus and show symptoms. \"The lower prevalence may reflect the social context,\" said Muntau. During the lockdown, children were at most in a very small group in emergency care and then back home. However, her parents sometimes met colleagues at work, went shopping and ran other errands. \"You had a different contact profile. I can well imagine that is the reason.\" This is also indicated by the fact that children and adolescents with pre-existing illnesses were infected significantly less frequently in the Hamburg study. Antibodies were found in one percent of them. The rate for children and adolescents without previous illnesses was 1.7 percent. \"This is above all an indication that children with previous illnesses were better protected and shielded from possible sources of infection,\" says Muntau. In the study, a third of the children and adolescents had previous illnesses. It is therefore not representative of Hamburg, so it cannot be derived from how many children and adolescents in the city have been infected with the new corona virus so far. In the preliminary evaluation, the team found no infections in any child or adolescent until June 5. This also shows that the protective measures have taken effect. The researchers have also started to examine the families of children with corona antibodies more closely. When analyzing more than a hundred parents and siblings, it turned out that the whole family had not always been infected when a member was ill. \"In half of the families in which at least one adult tested positive, not all of the children were positive,\" Muntau explains. Previous evaluations came to a similar conclusion. It was only on Tuesday that the state of Baden-Württemberg, together with four university hospitals located there, published data in advance on children under the age of ten, which had been collected from April 22 to May 15. 2500 parent-child pairs were tested there for antibodies against the new virus. Endured infection was demonstrated in 45 parents, but only in 19 children. The parents had not necessarily infected their children. The background to the study in Baden-Württemberg was that children make a significant contribution to the spread of many respiratory diseases, such as the flu. A child brings the infection to the kindergarten, kindergarten or school, and shortly afterwards numerous classmates and parents fall ill. Since the new corona virus is also a respiratory pathogen, researchers initially assumed that children play a similar role in its spread. The antibody study from Baden-Württemberg shows that this has not been the case so far. A study in the specialist magazine \"Nature\" also concludes that children and adolescents under 20 years of age only get infected about half as often as adults. Researchers led by Nicholas Davies from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine analyzed data from China, Italy, Japan, Singapore, Canada and South Korea in a mathematical model. Researchers tend to come to a similar result in an evaluation in the Netherlands (read more about this here). However, all of these studies are not evidence that children play no role in the spread of the new virus and cannot clarify how the virus would have spread without daycare, kindergarten and school closures. Muntau is therefore still skeptical. In Sweden, where, with a few exceptions, public education and childcare services remained open throughout the entire pandemic, Muntau said that as many or even more children were infected than adults. In addition, current data from the Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians in Hamburg showed that as many children are now being tested positive as adults. Even the first cases after school openings show that educational institutions can become hotspots if the virus is carried in. In a high school in Augustusburg in Saxony, for example, 75 pupils in fifth, seventh and ninth grade had contact with an infected teacher, so far the virus has been detected in 24 of them. It remains open how contagious children are once they have the virus in them. In a much-discussed study, the Berlin-based virologist Christian Drosten came to the conclusion that children who were found to have an infection have as much virus in their throat as adults. At least that's an indication that they could be similarly contagious, but not evidence. Discussions include whether children fight the virus faster due to their more active immune system and are thus infectious over a shorter period of time. In adults, in particular, the phase around the beginning of the first symptoms seems to be risky for contagion. In contrast, children rarely develop symptoms at all. \"The question of how contagious children are can not be clarified in the current situation,\" said Muntau. When the virus was rampant in Germany, infection chains were not followed up in detail and children were often not tested. Therefore, one does not know who infected whom in families. \"I don't hope we'll get a second wave,\" Muntau says. \"But only then can central questions be answered clearly.\"\n",

            " A man is said to have kept his mother's body in an apartment in Bruchsal near Karlsruhe for five years to collect her pension. Neighbors had not seen the woman for a long time and the police informed Monday, the investigators said. In the evening a patrol drove to the apartment building. The 65-year-old initially got involved in contradictions, the police and prosecutors said. Finally, he led the officers to the body in a bedroom on the first floor. According to the son, the mother died in August 2015 at the age of 89. The man said he had no income of his own. He had therefore made a living from his mother's pension payments. The public prosecutor's office in Karlsruhe ordered an autopsy. Accordingly, the date of death given by the son was compatible with the condition of the body. The cause of death has not yet been determined with certainty. The man is now under investigation for fraud among other things.\n",

Since the pandemic broke out, the Hamburg event catering company, together with its business partners Johannes Riffelmacher and Patrick Rüther, has been primarily committed to ensuring that its industry does not go to the dogs. A few weeks ago, the troops placed 420 empty chairs on Hamburg's Rathausmarkt, this week they handed over a petition with 123,000 signatures to the Federal Ministry of Economics. Now she wants to raise even heavier guns - and, if necessary, sue for compensation in court. The restaurateurs have teamed up with the Berlin law firm Gansel Rechtsanwälte to plan a campaign against the state and to get as many colleagues as possible to participate. \"Restaurateurs hit the crisis harder than many others,\" says Elci. \"It would only be fair if society compensated for that.\" Many lawyers are convinced that thousands of companies are entitled to compensation for the lockdown. In his view, not only restaurants or hotels, but also fitness and yoga studios, event agencies or retailers are eligible, says Berlin lawyer Wolfgang Schirp, who represents around 430 clients across Germany.

            " EY's auditors had criticized Wirecard for lacking evidence of the existence of 1.9 billion euros. The Dax group is said to have parked them in trust accounts in Asia. On Friday, however, the BDO Unibank and the Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI) declared in unison: \"Wirecard is not a customer of ours.\" Now the Central Bank of the Philippines has announced: The money is not in the country. \"The first report says that no money has reached the Philippines,\" said Benjamin Diokno, president of Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas. The central bank is investigating the case further. On Friday, BPI had stated that documents submitted by external Wirecard auditors were forged. The case will be investigated further. BDO said that papers that were supposed to confirm a Wirecard account with the bank had false signatures from bank representatives. Wirecard postponed the publication of the long-awaited annual financial statements for 2019 for the fourth time on Thursday, on the grounds that EY's auditors found no evidence of the existence of the 1.9 billion euros. The amount corresponds to around a quarter of the total assets. Wirecard sees itself as a victim and has filed a complaint against unknown persons. The top management believes to have been cheated out of the missing money. In view of this new high point in the balance sheet scandal, many investors separated from Wirecard shares on Saturday. At the broker Lang & Schwarz, the papers of the Dax group were listed in the early afternoon at 22.25 euros, almost 14 percent below their Friday closing price. Daily sales were exceptionally high at around two million euros. The creditor banks apparently do not want to drop Wirecard, at least in the short term. \"No one has an interest in canceling the loan,\" said the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sunday newspaper from one of the participating banks. \"Everyone now wants to stabilize the thing in the short term.\" From the Wirecard environment, it was said that the company, which had been hard hit, needed an \"advance in trust\". One hopes for an agreement by the end of next week. Nevertheless, there are fears that many Wirecard customers could quickly turn their backs on the payment service provider from Aschheim near Munich. The rating agency Moody´s also pointed out this danger and lowered its credit rating to junk level. A consortium of 15 creditor banks could terminate a loan to Wirecard of EUR 1.75 billion at any time because the company did not publish the annual financial statements in time - and thus violated contractual clauses. Wirecard announced on Friday evening that it had hired investment bank Houlihan Lokey to develop \"a plan for the company's sustainable financing strategy\". Houlihan Lokey is a specialist in difficult restructuring and bankruptcy cases and has already been active in matters of Enron, Lehman Brothers and - in this country - Steinhoff.\n",

The accounting firm EY assumes serious crime on a quasi global scale. \"There is clear evidence that this is a large-scale fraud involving multiple parties around the world and in various institutions with deliberate intent to deceive,\" said EY. \"As part of the final audit for the 2019 financial year, EY discovered that fake balance confirmations and other falsified documents were submitted for the escrow accounts.\" EY had informed the responsible authorities as well as the company and its supervisory board. \"Conspiracy fraud aimed at deceiving investors and the public is often accompanied by extensive efforts to systematically and on a large scale falsify documents,\" the release said. \"Even with extensively expanded audit procedures, it may not be possible to detect this type of conspiratorial fraud.\" EY is one of the four major international accounting firms. The company had audited Wirecard's annual financial statements in previous years, so far without any objections. That is why EY is now faced with harsh criticism for not having discovered the alleged manipulations earlier. Wirecard filed an application for insolvency proceedings with the Munich District Court on Thursday, and the share of the Dax group fell 80 percent in some cases. It had previously emerged that the annual balance sheet lacked 1.9 billion euros. The group believes that the money at two Filipino banks \"almost certainly\" does not exist. The public prosecutor's office in Munich I accuses Wirecard boss Markus Braun, who resigned last week, of having inflated Wirecard's total assets and sales volume with fake receipts along with other suspected perpetrators. Braun was briefly arrested on Tuesday and later released on bail of five million euros. Previously, he had raised a total of 155 million euros in a series of share sales.\n",

            " In Bremerhaven, the police recovered a car with two bodies from the Weser on Thursday. As reported by the West Palatinate Police Headquarters in Rhineland-Palatinate, the dead are believed to be a mother and daughter from Kaiserslautern. The 46-year-old and the ten-year-old child have been missing for ten days. The police had last searched for them in Bremerhaven. In the car sunken in the river there were identification documents of the 46-year-old, as the investigators in Kaiserslautern, Bremen and Ravensburg in Baden-Württemberg said. The girl's father lives nearby. He lives separately from the mother and informed the police that the police had not brought the child back to him as agreed on Monday last week. According to their own statements, the investigators had previously indicated that the mother and daughter were in Bremerhaven on the weekend before the child returned to the father. The 46-year-old had booked a hotel room there for herself and her daughter, both of whom probably visited the zoo there on Saturday and Sunday. The sunken car was discovered in the immediate vicinity. The car was found and recovered on Thursday during a targeted search with a special boat. What exactly happened, however, was initially unclear, according to the police. \"The circumstances that led to the death of the missing have not yet been clarified,\" said the officials. The two bodies would be autopsied in the coming days. The identity should then also be finally clarified. Accordingly, a large-scale search and search operation had been running since last week, which in addition to Rhineland-Palatinate, Bremen and Baden-Württemberg also included other possible transit countries such as Hesse and North Rhine-Westphalia and neighboring countries. According to the investigators, sonar boats, search dogs, helicopters and an airplane were also used. In addition, a nationwide public search for the two missing persons was carried out.\n",

The situation calmed down after several hours. Forces from across the state had been ordered to the state capital of Baden-Württemberg to deal with the situation. Video recordings of the street battles circulated on the short message service Twitter. The pictures show young men kicking shop windows or tearing paving stones out of the ground. The police spokesman said, \"There was a real rampage.\" A whole series of shops were affected, including vehicles. There were also looting. The focus was on the Schlossplatz and the neighboring Königstrasse, the main shopping street in Stuttgart. So far nothing is known about the background of the conflict and the exact number of rioters. The police spoke of hundreds of people who were traveling in small groups. More than a dozen officers were injured. As the police said on Sunday, more than 20 people have been arrested. The riots started around midnight, the police spokesman said. On Sunday morning it was said that the situation had calmed down. The damage was still visible: the window panes of several mobile phone shops were broken. Among other things, an ice cream parlor on Königstrasse and a well-known clothing store near Charlottenplatz were affected by the riot. For security, the police remain present in the city center with a large contingent, said the police spokesman in the morning. Stuttgart Mayor Fritz Kuhn (Greens) has strongly condemned the riots in downtown Stuttgart. \"One thing must be clear: there must be no lawless rooms in Stuttgart,\" Kuhn said on Sunday morning on Twitter. \"I am shocked by the outbreak of violence, the attacks on the police and the destruction in our city. It is a sad Sunday for Stuttgart.\" Last weekend there were also clashes between mostly young people and the police - but not to a similar extent. At first, the police did not comment on whether the mastermind behind the recent destruction was police-related scenes. A few days ago, the Stuttgart police had spoken after incidents on the sidelines of a demonstration of border crossings. \"Parts of the left scene cross straight lines here, which we have never seen before in Stuttgart,\" said a police spokesman at the time.\n",

            " The chemical company Bayer has achieved a billion-dollar comparison with the glyphosate claimants in the United States. The Leverkusen-based company said on Wednesday that it would pay up to 9.8 billion euros to settle the ongoing proceedings and for possible future cases. The background to this are lawsuits from users of the controversial weed killer Roundup, who blame the glyphosate-containing agent for their cancer. The agreement would bring \"75 percent of the current roundup procedures to a conclusion -\" with a total of approximately 125,000 lawsuits filed and not filed, \"said Bayer. In addition to the € 9.8 billion that is now planned, there would be a further € 1.1 billion \"to enable a separate agreement for potential future lawsuits\". A judge in the US state of California still had to agree to this part of the agreement. \"The agreements were unanimously approved by the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board of Bayer AG with the participation of a special committee on the glyphosate legal complex,\" said the chemical group. \"They contain no admission of guilt or wrongdoing.\" Disputes about the weed killer Dicamba are said to have been settled in the process. Up to EUR 354 million will be paid in connection with lawsuits due to the Dicamba drift and allegedly caused crop damage, the agricultural chemical and pharmaceutical company said. The lawsuits brought together in a Missouri court affect the 2015 to 2020 harvest years. However, Bayer in California does not have to point out any possible cancer risks from glyphosate. In a decision last Monday, a federal judge in Sacramento granted Bayer and other companies an application not to comply with a state requirement.\n",

            " After the corona outbreak in his meat company with more than a thousand confirmed cases so far, Clemens Tönnies is under increasing pressure. The long-time federal data protection officer Peter Schaar calls the claims of the top management \"advanced\" that data protection has made it difficult to provide employee addresses to contain the Corona outbreak. \"It is a straightforward protection claim that Tönnies was supposedly not allowed to save the data of the contractors,\" said Schaar to SPIEGEL. \"It really annoys me that data protection is made the culprit in such a serious case.\" From 2003 to 2013, Schaar was the top data protection officer in the Federal Republic. In the night from Friday to Saturday, investigators from the Gütersloh district and occupational health and safety came to Tönnies and obtained access to data from contractors - after the company had initially not provided the addresses of 30 percent of these employees. The head of the crisis team then said that trust in the company was \"zero\". Peter Schaar (archive picture) Clemens Tönnies later justified himself with data protection. Work contractors may only save last names, first names, gender and date of birth. \"Actually, we are not allowed to have these addresses, it is data protection. Work contract law does not actually give us the right to have this data or home addresses.\" With reference to the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), co-managing director Anders Ruff even said: \"We must not have the data of employees who work for service providers. It would be a crime if we had it.\" Data protection Schaar described these statements to SPIEGEL as \"advanced\": \"There is no violation of the GDPR here.\" Article 6 of the EU regulation allows the processing of such data by contractors as well - provided that this is necessary to safeguard the legitimate interests of the person responsible or a third party. Tönnies himself left a SPIEGEL request unanswered. \"In principle, a company has a legitimate interest in being able to contact people who bring it into the company as an employee,\" said Schaar. \"And since the first major corona outbreaks in other slaughterhouses, there have been many legitimate interests, if not the obligation, to store this information.\" Tönnies had to expect that the addresses would one day be used to track contact chains and contain infection sources. \"Tönnies was allowed to save the addresses,\" says Schaar. \"And there are indications that the group actually did it. Then it is even more ridiculous to delay the publication by referring to data protection.\" On the other hand, the investigators had acted correctly: \"Of course, the authorities can also request the disclosure of such information in such a case in the event of danger to life and limb.\"\n",

            " Angela Merkel does not stop at her own government with her criticism either. In the Chancellery, a share of 50 percent has now been reached \"at the highest management level\". \"In the highest federal authorities as a whole, however, the proportion of women in management positions has increased only sparsely to 36 percent.\" And so the Chancellor and CDU politician came to the overall conclusion: there is still a lot to be done for equal opportunities for men and women in working life. \"We have made good progress, but we are still far from where we want to be: parity is the goal,\" said Merkel in a greeting for the annual conference of the Chefsache initiative, an association of companies, including Volkswagen, Siemens, IBM, Google, Deutsche Bahn, Airbus, Allianz and BASF. In the current crisis as a result of the corona pandemic, according to Merkel, \"it is even more a question of economic reason that women can really develop their potential,\" she said. To achieve equal opportunities, however, \"a cultural change is still required\". Merkel pointed out that flexible work, for example in the home office, does not automatically mean a step towards more equal opportunities. \"Many working women would not confirm this given the extra work involved in childcare and housework.\" The Chancellor is the patron of the initiative. According to Merkel, there is also a need to catch up on the participation of women on the supervisory boards of listed and co-determined companies. On the executive boards, the proportion of women is not even at eleven percent. If companies set \"zero percent\" as the target for board members, \"then I have zero understanding for it,\" said Merkel. The proportion of women, especially in new and emerging corporations, is often particularly bad: \"Promoters in Dax and MDax even regularly lower the women's quotas,\" said US personnel consultant Russell Reynolds. Current example: With Lufthansa's relegation from the Dax - at least a 17 percent share of women on the board - the real estate group Deutsche Wohnen moves up - without a single woman on the board. In the MDax of medium-sized stocks, the Deutsche Pfandbriefbank is replaced by the advertising marketer Stöer - without a woman on the board. \"Of the 29 climbers in the second most important German stock market index in the last two years, 25 do not have a female board member,\" write the personnel consultant. The women's quota also suffered as a result of Thyssenkrupp's relegation from the Dax in autumn: while Martina Merz, as head of the steel company, is developing a reputation as a tough renovator, the rising engine manufacturer MTU Aero Engines does not have a single female board member. \"The last four promoters to the Dax have an average female quota of just 13 percent, which is half the women's quota as the companies that have displaced them.\" In turn, out of 40 of the 60 companies in the MDax, not even a woman was on the board. The rates in other countries, according to Russell Reynolds, are higher. The consultants cite the USA, Great Britain, France, the Scandinavian states, the Netherlands and Spain as examples. Apart from the board, inequality is mainly reflected in the different salaries. Paying childless women and men for life as a whole is now similar, as a recent study by the Bertelsmann Stiftung shows. But women who are mothers have to accept a sharp drop in salaries of around 40 percent on average for only one child and almost 70 percent for three or more children.\n",

            " The intention of the Ministers of Education to return to regular operations in Germany's schools after the summer holidays and to abolish the distance rule has met with harsh criticism from teacher associations. \"With this announcement, the ministers of culture overturn the protection against infection,\" said Ilka Hoffmann, spokeswoman for the school area of ​​the Education and Science Union (GEW), the SPIEGEL. \"If that goes wrong, the culture ministers are responsible.\" The Kultusministerkonferenz (KMK) announced after a video switch on Thursday that it wanted to open all schools again in the new school year. Students should be taught in normal class groups or in fixed groups without having to keep a minimum distance of 1.50 meters. The education politicians restricted the project with the addition, \"provided the infection process allows it\". In the past few weeks, several federal states such as Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Schleswig-Holstein, Thuringia and North Rhine-Westphalia have abolished the distance rule at primary schools. The risk of infection should be minimized by allowing children to learn in fixed groups that meet as little as possible. In the event of infection, the chain of infection should be traceable. \"At smaller primary schools, this may still be feasible here and there,\" said Hoffmann. But the large secondary schools would often bring together a thousand children and young people from one region. The students would take buses to class in the morning, \"and the buses are full,\" says Hoffmann. Schools with around a thousand students could not come to class with a delayed schedule or have a break with a delay. \"Nor can you tell the students that they shouldn't mix in the school yard,\" criticized the trade unionist. \"How is that supposed to work in practice? This is unrealistic. It is thoughtless to put responsibility on the schools now.\" The president of the German Teachers' Association, Heinz-Peter Meidinger, also criticized sharply. It was premature to \"announce this in this absoluteness,\" he told the \"Augsburger Allgemeine\". The KMK has bowed too quickly and without its own concept to the pressure from the prime ministers, but also from business and \"parents burdened with additional childcare\". In the past few days, Meidinger had already asked that the ministers of education first have to develop a completely revised hygiene concept for the next school year so that schools and school authorities can plan. As the president of the KMK and Rhineland-Palatinate Minister of Education Stefanie Hubig (SPD) announced after the discussions with her country colleagues, such a concept should now be developed in a next step. It is said to be available before the end of the summer vacation. It should also clarify whether there should be a mask requirement in schools. Against the background of the now three-month state of emergency at schools, Meidinger spoke in favor of compulsory performance tests for all pupils after the summer holidays and when there were serious gaps in knowledge for remedial teaching. \"For pupils with severe deficits, there must be compulsory support programs that can take place in the afternoon, for example.\" To manage such an additional offer, the schools would need additional staff.\n",

            " Singer Udo Lindenberg's Porsche has reappeared. The 74-year-old's car had been stolen from the Hotel Atlantic's underground car park in Hamburg on Tuesday. The vehicle, with an alleged value of around 600,000 euros, was discovered on Thursday in an underground car park in Ahrensburg in Schleswig-Holstein, said a police spokesman. A witness noticed the car about 20 kilometers away from the hotel, because otherwise it was not in the underground car park. Then she called the police. Lindenberg himself was grateful and relieved: \"The car is back, of course I'm pleased,\" he said to NDR Info on the phone. \"I'm on my way to the criminal police station - then we'll see.\" However, the 74-year-old still had to be patient. First of all, all traces must be secured, said the police spokesman. The singer had noticed the theft on Tuesday night at 3 a.m. when he wanted to take one of his nightly jaunts with the Porsche. The car is a Porsche 911 R, of which only 991 were built. The new car is said to have cost around 200,000 euros, but the value of the collector's item is now three times as high. Lindenberg has lived in the Atlantic for more than 25 years. According to media reports, he recently moved to another location because of the corona crisis.\n",

            " The so-called way council for cybersecurity in Germany is committed to turning away from complicated requirements when creating passwords. \"It is a widespread misconception that stricter guidelines increase the quality of passwords,\" says the annual report of the six renowned professors from the field of cyber security, which was published in Bonn on Wednesday. There are situations in which stricter rules sometimes even degrade the quality of the passwords chosen. It is particularly important to no longer provide passwords with an expiry date. \"It is much more dangerous to use the same password for multiple services than not to change the password regularly for one service,\" said Matthew Smith, professor at the University of Bonn and the Fraunhofer Institute for Communication, Information Processing, and Ergonomics FKIE. A change is only recommended if there are signs that the password has been spied on or compromised in some other way. Smith said the password age no longer played a role in the latest guidelines from the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI). That is a good development. However, he asked the BSI to provide the authorities and companies with uniform requirements for the password guidelines. You should follow the recommendations of the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) and the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). A long time ago, OWAPS and NIST said goodbye to most of the restrictions on password assignment and gave users more freedom in choosing a password. This no longer requires the most complicated structures made up of numbers and special characters, but longer passphrases. The recommendations of the Wise Council for cybersecurity also concern the so-called smart cities. \"Digital infrastructures in networked cities should remain available, understandable and manageable at all times,\" said Matthias Hollick, professor for security in mobile networks at the Technical University of Darmstadt. \"Crises such as cyber attacks, natural events, human and technical failure, and violence and terror jeopardize the reliable operation of IT systems.\" It was therefore necessary to be able to guarantee the operation of critical infrastructures even in the event of a crisis and with a high degree of networking. The Wise Council for Cyber ​​Security was formed in 2019 and is coordinated by the Cyber ​​Security Cluster Bonn. In the association, companies such as Bechtle, Deutsche Telekom, IBM and Deutsche Post DHL work together with scientific institutions such as various Fraunhofer institutes and public bodies. Similar to the report of the Council of Experts on the assessment of macroeconomic development - the so-called economic modes - the Wise Council for Cybersecurity wants to present an annual report that is intended to serve as a guide for politics and business.\n",

In the morning they came by car from Hamburg to Berlin, here to Tegel, to say goodbye and to tell the glorious story of the airport they created together. But what can you say when the airport is almost shut down? All gates in Terminal A are closed. The shops are closed. The travel agencies are closed. In the shop windows there are still offers like postcards from a distant time: a week Cancun, Mexico, 1048 euros. Eleven days Seychelles, half board, 2153 euros.

            " For weeks the number of reproductions R in Germany was below the critical value of 1, and the situation seemed to be slowly easing, at least in this country. Now the number of new infections and with it R has risen again significantly - to an apparently questionable level: In the current Corona management report of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), the so-called 4-day R value is given as 2.88. This means that an infected person infects two to three other people on average - the virus spreads exponentially. Now comes the feared second wave? Probably not. At least not now in Germany. In order to understand why R has risen so suddenly, one must first look at how the value is calculated. The reproduction rate was previously one of the most important measures for controlling the corona measures. R indicates the average number of people infected by an infected person. If the value is above 1, the disease spreads arithmetically, if it is below, the infection numbers decrease. Among other things, R is influenced by measures such as keeping a distance, immunity in the population or the transmission capacity of a virus. So it is not a property of the pathogen, but depends on various external factors. The RKI estimates the current pandemic development in a complicated procedure called \"nowcasting\". In order to calculate the number of reproductions, the institute uses the number of new infections and relates them to each other (read more here about which data SPIEGEL uses in the corona crisis). Between May 23 and June 15, the number of new infections, from which the R-value is calculated, ranged between 300 and 450, according to the RKI. Then the number increased significantly. This is mainly due to the outbreak at Tönnies in the North Rhine-Westphalian district of Gütersloh as well as minor outbreaks in the Lower Saxony district of Göttingen and in an apartment block in Berlin-Neukölln. The three hotspots accounted for more than a third of confirmed new corona infections in the past seven days. The remaining 2341 new infections in the rest of the country correspond to the equivalent of 334 new cases per day - a similar level as before. In particular, the new infections reported to Tönnies are likely to have significantly increased the 4-day R value. The outbreak is currently the largest corona hotspot in Germany. The extent of the slaughterhouse outbreak became known about a week ago. However, due to the incubation period, the employees must have been infected at least five to six days beforehand - and may have infected others during this time. There are now more than 1,300 positive corona findings. The test results must be reported to the health authorities, who in turn pass them on to the RKI. All these delays are taken into account when calculating the pandemic. Nevertheless, the 4-day R-value could be so high, mainly because of the mass tests at Tönnies and the other local outbreak events. In order to compensate for such strong fluctuations, the RKI has now given yet another number, the 7-day R value. This shows the infection process about one to a little more than two weeks ago. However, the 7-day R-value was 2.03 on Monday, well above the critical mark. This is not surprising either: the outbreaks at Tönnies, in the high-rise building in Göttingen and in the residential complex in Berlin-Neukölln all became known last week. Mass tests were immediately carried out everywhere, presumably many cases were discovered that would otherwise not have been noticed. The positive results were then reported to the RKI almost simultaneously. The high number of new infections is therefore very likely strongly influenced by the local outbreaks. So it is the high number of reproductions. When assessing the situation, the institute does not only look at the R value, because this is only of limited significance due to the many influencing factors. Also important are the number of new infections in a daily comparison, the number of positive tests and the burden on the health care system. On Sunday, it was said that the RKI currently continues to assess the overall health risk in Germany as \"high\" and for risk groups as \"very high\".\n",

            " SPIEGEL: Professor Groebner, the holiday season has begun - but a lot is different this year. Anyone who has booked a trip abroad is worried about whether and how they can start it. Traveling for pleasure and relaxation is considered a good place to live today. How long has it been like this? Valentin Groebner, 58, teaches medieval history at the University of Lucerne. He made a name for himself with studies of modern history and historical narration. In 2018 his book Retroland was published. History tourism and the longing for the authentic, S. Fischer Verlag, Frankfurt am Main. Groebner: Since industrialization. The fact that normal industrial workers and employees can even go on vacation is a maximum of 70 years old, tourism as a phenomenon of the middle classes is 150 years old. Before that, hardly anyone could afford it; the transport and subsistence costs were far too high compared to the available wages. The fact that we travel naturally and frequently is therefore not based on an urge for freedom, but on the mass prosperity after the Second World War. SPIEGEL: But there were also ancient Romans who wanted to see the pyramids and later gentlemen who went on the \"Grand Tour\"? Groebner: Yes, but that was always very, very few from the top class. When Michel de Montaigne traveled to Italy in 1580, he knew the few compatriots he met there from the French court. SPIEGEL: So travel is a very young luxury phenomenon? Groebner: I don't like to use such a derogatory expression. In 2019, 1.5 billion people traveled - the highest number ever determined. They don't all do something completely superfluous. Conversely: we are now experiencing a temporary return to control and border regimes, as they existed in the twenties or fifties of the 20th century, and we are confused: suddenly, restriction and nation-state return, which before, in the supposedly good old days, made traveling a tedious, tedious thing for most people. SPIEGEL: In the good old days, there were travel guides that also explained the area visited historically. Only a few were looking for nature, right? Groebner: That's right. Before the 19th century, nobody wanted to go to the beach. SPIEGEL: Was it primarily about understanding the country and its people culturally? Groebner: Yes, especially the remains of the great past. The oldest travel guide for Rome, the \"Mirabilia Urbis Romae\", was written by an Englishman in the 12th century. Vacation in the good old days SPIEGEL: Wasn't the plant mainly a pilgrim guide? Groebner: There are also astonishingly pious things in it. For example, a naked marble statue of Venus is described, clearly a pagan work. The ancient world was considered a super civilization, a more perfect counter-age. The remains of this imagined chamber of wonder of the past were admired. The image was conveyed through wild, colorful stories. The so-called Gesta Romanorum, \"Acts of the Romans\", have been widespread since the 14th century, full of betrayal, murder and homicide in many morally exemplary, captivating stories. Educated people had already learned their Latin from the poems and historical works of the ancient Romans. SPIEGEL: Did you consciously seek out the scenes of major government actions, battles and exploits? St. Mark's Square in Venice Groebner: Some did. Others didn't care, they wanted to go to the prostitutes in Venice, of which there were printed catalogs for tourists from the 16th century. Most of the travel guides offered as broad a range of topics as possible, in part because it justified why the expensive trip had been taken. Being able to demonstrate world knowledge helped with my career. Some then simply wrote in their own travel reports what was in the guide to make an impression. SPIEGEL: So the tourist before 1800 drove to places he already knew from reading - to experience them culturally as his own? Groebner: Mostly yes. The only exceptions are trips to nature: in seaside resorts, to thermal springs, there were those very early; and then into the wild, romantically inflated Alps, around 1770. SPIEGEL: Did you want to immerse yourself in history as a traveler? Groebner: At least some wanted that. When Johann Gottfried Seume, an under-educated citizen with military experience, walked from Grimma to Syracuse on foot in 1802, he had his ancient classics with him. Still, he was disappointed at how little you saw. It was from this need that historical monuments emerged in the 19th century: Europe was deliberately rehistorized - and in turn promoted further historical tourism. Hermann Monument in the Teutoburg Forest SPIEGEL: Monuments to large battles such as the Hermann Monument in the Teutoburg Forest or the Niederwald Monument with its Germania obviously served to strengthen nationalism. Were there examples of such bourgeois excursion sites? Groebner: Battle chapels have been built in Italy, France and Switzerland since around 1500. They almost always come from the winners. But there they thought of the dead locally, they were hardly real travel destinations. The best way to forget lost battles, of course. Victories on the other hand - especially those over the Ottoman Empire - were monumentalized and designed. SPIEGEL: All of this sounds as if genuine, unfiltered curiosity about the past, like then, was the complete exception. Or do you even think it is impossible? Groebner: The kind of past that you want to have yourself is always reconstructed, exhibited and celebrated. The past, which is used for political and tourist purposes, is a first-person narrative, a kind of distant mirror in which one looks at oneself. On the other hand, curiosity and the desire to be on the move in certain phases of life seem to me to be a basic human characteristic. In pre-modern times, very few could really afford this \"vacation\". Vacation is a very old word, it means: discharge from duty. SPIEGEL: It is precisely this obligation - including the release from the prescribed house arrest - that many are concerned with today. You simply dream of basking on a beach lounger ... On the deck of a Groebner cruise ship: That is also strange. SPIEGEL published a cover story a year and a half ago: How the tourist destroys what he loves. Do we want to go back to \"overtourism\"? Is it the good old days? But hardly. The vacation has long been a consumption ritual, not a discharge from duty, but just another kind of duty. I find cruise ships particularly strange where enormous discipline is necessary - \"entertainment barracks\" would have been what the cultural philosopher Siegfried Kracauer called it. Perhaps we should take advantage of the current crisis and think more freely about being released from duty. SPIEGEL: What do you mean? For example: rediscover local museums in your free time? Groebner: Let us hope that this will happen - but don't forget: According to the latest reliable figures, the German museums had more visitors than all the Bundesliga games together. No, I mean something simpler: Tourism, which is supposed to serve the good life, is the opposite of employment; this is how it came into being. New forms could focus even more on informality and doing nothing, thus relieving them of the supposed educational obligation. SPIEGEL: Do you recommend meditation leave? Groebner: (laughs) The great thing about the industry is that it promises to keep customers from being saved from the industry itself. But the auto industry can do that too. They are simply mature service industries that offer complete artificial worlds - and now in a next turn also market the escape from these worlds that they have created. SPIEGEL: No escape offers are discernible on the pop culture history market; the range extends from the archeology app to the crusader game, from reenacting medieval battles to the television series. Are you a scientist worried about this virtual past tourism? Groebner: No. All of these phenomena arose like tourism itself in the 19th century. It was industrialization that turned the austere Middle Ages into the origin of one's own, the tempting, picturesque counter-world. Since then, citizens have disguised themselves as knights and performed historical dramas - preferably at the original location. Literary re-enactments, first on the opera stage, the mass medium of that time, are now being replaced by new technical toys. The mode of thinking, the search for romantic originality and intensity, has remained the same. Price inquiry time 26.06.2020 03.33 no guarantee SPIEGEL: Has your own wanderlust and your curiosity about history changed when you think about these phenomena? Groebner: Yes. I just finished a book called \"Ferienmüde\". There is, for example, a chapter on the tropical beach: What are we looking for? Or: In a picturesque old town with geraniums in front of the windows like Salzburg or Constance, what do we actually see? What does the tourist find at the destination of his longing? As often as one has thought critically about it - so far this has only led to even more tourism offers. But now there are clearly limits to growth. Maybe we are experiencing the end of \"Endless Vacation\". Let's wait and see.\n",

            " The creator of the art catastrophe was reportedly given a second chance, but again the overwhelmed man could only deliver a better child's drawing. Now another expert should try to save the picture, but the hopes are low, it said. The case evokes memories of a failed restoration of a Jesus fresco that made headlines and malice worldwide in 2012. The attempt by an then 80-year-old amateur restorer to repair a wall painting of the chapel in Borja near Saragossa from the 19th century ended with the destruction of the image of Christ. Destroyed works of art: well-intentioned, badly done. At the time, amused media renamed the image from \"Ecce homo\" (as the representation of the thorn-crowned Christ in art is called) to \"Ecce mono\" (roughly \"Monkey Jesus\"). This type of blemish \"is unfortunately much more common than expected,\" said ACRE coordinator María Borja Ortiz. \"There are countless cases in which people without adequate training destroy works of art forever and ever.\" Meanwhile, Borja made a virtue of necessity. Thanks to marketing campaigns, the \"Ecce mono\" became a major tourist attraction. The defaced picture adorns T-shirts and mugs. Between 2013 and 2018, more than 200,000 domestic and foreign tourists visited the 4900-person village in Aragon. Visitors even pay admission to take a selfie with the \"monkey Jesus\".\n",

If they get less than they expected for their money and the product does not do what was announced. In some cases, the mismatch between aspiration and reality becomes apparent very quickly. In others, it can take a while. There are some indications that this is exactly the case with the latest government stimulus package. When the grand coalition presented its so-called powerhouse in early June, the approval was unanimous. Citizens were impressed, the polls showed that the government had acted quickly. And the economists praised the program as \"surprisingly large\" and \"well thought out\". In the meantime, however, there are doubts in the professional world whether the price-performance ratio of the latest coalition product is right. The 130 billion euros of the package are being spent on all sorts of purposes that are currently well received by the public - such as climate protection, e-mobility or digitalization.

            " The police spokesman said that the state security was deliberately chosen as a test body because it was responsible for politically motivated crime. The investigations there went in all directions and were open to results. An exchange with the public prosecutor's office for cybercrime is planned so that it can investigate if there is initial suspicion. Furthermore, the Brandenburg state security was in exchange with the LKA Berlin, since Hildmann recently made several speeches at demonstrations against the corona restrictions in the federal capital, the spokesman said. From the point of view of the police in Brandenburg, Hildmann's online activities cannot be separated from his public appearances. When asked by SPIEGEL, the Berlin police said that there was currently no investigation into Hildmann in connection with his speeches. However, advertisements in connection with Hildmann's network statements were also received in Berlin, which had been forwarded to the responsible LKA Brandenburg. Editor's note: The statement by the Berlin police was added and updated subsequently.\n",

            " As a result of the corona crisis, many German companies expect fewer business trips in the long term. A majority of 57 percent think such a decline is likely, according to the Ifo Institute's economic survey. This has consequences for other sectors of the economy: \"The consequences of the corona crisis will continue to accompany some sectors for a very long time, such as airlines, railways, hotels and restaurants,\" said Ifo researcher Stefan Sauer. Many of the companies that want to send their employees on business trips particularly cautiously in the future come from industry. 64 percent of the manufacturing companies expect such a decline, among service providers it is still 60 percent. Retail is less affected with 39 percent and construction with 29 percent. In the future, the pharmaceutical industry (80 percent) and computer manufacturers (77 percent) want to travel very little in industry. IT service providers also want to travel significantly less - and the management consultants who have traveled a lot so far, each with 80 percent. Companies from research and development (74 percent) and from advertising and market research (72 percent) also want to send their employees far less frequently.\n",

            " Three people were shot and killed in a spontaneous street festival in the state of North Carolina following the end of slavery in the United States. The incident in Charlotte on Monday night saw more than a hundred shots fired in a crowd of around 400 people, deputy chief of police Gerald Smith said on Monday. At first the police spoke of two deaths. In addition, seven people were injured by gunfire, at least three of them seriously. One of these seriously injured people died a little later. Five other people sustained injuries from being hit by cars, the police said on Twitter. Despite the large number of people who were there, no eyewitnesses reported to the police, Smith said. He described the incident as \"very, very worrying\". It was initially unclear who fired the shots. The police do not rule out that there could have been several shooters. Since Friday, when \"Juneteenth\" was celebrated in the United States, several, sometimes unorganized, celebrations had taken place in Charlotte, police said. The end of slavery is commemorated on \"Juneteenth\". This year, memorial day also received a lot of attention beyond the United States due to nationwide protests against racism and police violence following the violent death of African American George Floyd.\n",

            " The book was published in 1996, and eleven years later Sean Penn filmed \"Into the Wild\". The story is told by Christopher McCandless, a dropout who leaves everything behind and flees to the Alaskan wilderness. Not only the soundtrack of Pearl Jam singer Eddie Vedder achieved cult status, but especially the bus, which McCandless found, became the symbol of the film. The vehicle on the border with Denali National Park attracted tourists until the very end. But that is over now. As the US state of Alaska announced, the bus was transported by helicopter. According to the officials, more and more adventurers had put themselves in danger by heading for the bus. \"We want to encourage people to enjoy Alaska's wild areas safely, and we understand the importance of the bus in public awareness,\" said Corri Feige, director of the Natural Resources and Environment Agency in Alaska. However, dangerous and expensive rescue operations had to be carried out over the years, said Feige. And what weighs the most: Some visitors died on trips to the bus. This is how two people died during river crossings. McCandless (played by Emile Hirsch) also died in the wild. Emile Hirsch as Christopher McCandless in \"Into the Wild\" A Brazilian tourist had to be saved in April, as did five Italians in February. Denali District Mayor Clay Walker called the removal of the bus \"a huge relief\". We know that it is the right step to guarantee public security. At the same time, Walker regrets the loss. The bus is part of the history of this area. What should happen to the bus is still unclear. The agency's statement states that the bus will be kept in a \"safe place\" until a final decision is made.

            " After finding 38 dead puppies on board an airplane, Ukrainian International Airlines (UIA) has temporarily suspended a high-ranking employee. The head of the department responsible for freight services was on leave, as the Ukrainian airline announced on Tuesday. In addition, UIA initially stopped transporting animals in its Boeing 767 aircraft. According to the airline, it has initiated an internal investigation into the death of the animals. Around 500 young French bulldogs were found during the inspection of a UIA machine at the airport in Toronto, Canada, of which 38 were dead. According to the Canadian authorities, the surviving animals suffered from dehydration, among other things. A dog dealer who had picked up another animal in the same cargo hold in which the bulldog puppies were found spoke on the CBC transmitter of a \"horror scene\". The Canadian authorities opened an investigation. In a first reaction, UIA was horrified by the \"tragic loss of animal life\". The company said it would cooperate with the Canadian authorities to investigate them. French bulldogs are very popular with dog owners in Canada. The expert Scott Weese told CBC that a sale price of 3000 to 4000 Canadian dollars (1950 to 2600 euros) can be expected per animal. Many Canadians mistakenly assumed that the dogs were bred in their own country, Weese said. It is unclear how many dogs are imported from abroad and where they come from. It is not uncommon for the dogs to be bred on a large scale, especially in Eastern Europe, according to animal rights activists, there are many such businesses. The welfare of the animals is at the bottom. Instead, the focus is on the sometimes substantial profit margins from the sale of the young dogs abroad.\n",

If you believe the depictions in films and series, the war in the Middle Ages must have been a slaughter at that time. It is difficult to research how cruel and bloody the struggles of the Middle Ages really were. Because the source situation is usually one-sided.

            " Facebook has to stop its cross-platform handling of user data in the previous form for the time being. The Federal Court of Justice (BGH) confirmed on Tuesday that the Federal Cartel Office had issued an injunction prohibiting it. The reason given by the guardians of the competition that Facebook is abusing its dominant position is not objectionable, according to the BGH in its rush decision. Before the BGH, the question was whether strict requirements of the Federal Cartel Office for processing user data apply immediately. The occasion was a decision by the Cartel Office in February 2019, according to which Facebook may only merge data from group-owned services such as WhatsApp and Instagram with the consent of the users. Back then, the competition authorities prohibited Facebook from merging user data from various sources into one profile without consent. This applies to data collected from in-house services, but also information from third-party websites. For this, the users' voluntary consent is required, the Cartel Office demanded. So far, this merging of the data has been possible solely on the basis of the terms of use, which Facebook users agree to. The Cartel Office believes that these terms violate data protection law. Based on this, the authority comes to the conclusion that Facebook is abusing a dominant position in the field of social networks. The key role of data in the business model of online companies is crucial because they can score points in the advertising market and earn money. \"Data is the oil that gets the internet business going,\" said Cartel Office President Andreas Mundt in February 2019. Facebook lodged a complaint against the decision of the competition authority, on which the responsible Higher Regional Court in Düsseldorf has not yet decided on the matter. However, it ordered that the Federal Cartel Office's decision not be enforced for the time being. In contrast, the Bundeskartellamt moved to the Federal Court of Justice. This has now led to the confirmation of the ban. Facebook can continue to sue the Cartel Office before the Düsseldorf Higher Regional Court, but must at least stick to the ban for as long. A Facebook spokesman said on Tuesday evening that the main trial before the Court of Appeals has not yet been completed: \"We will continue to defend our position that there is no abuse under antitrust law. There will be no immediate changes for the people or companies who use our products and services in Germany. \" The presiding judge Peter Meier-Beck also made clear in the three-hour hearing on Tuesday the fundamental issues connected with the legal dispute. Such a case could not have been negotiated ten years ago, he said in view of the rapid development in recent years. There is therefore also little specific basis in law for a decision. The controversial offer was also created by Facebook. \"However, this cannot mean that antitrust law should be kept out,\" said Meier-Beck. The presiding judge was convinced that users paid with their data. Linking them through Facebook can be seen as an improvement because the offer can be tailored perfectly to the individual user. The procedure could also be seen as an \"increased price\" because more data would have to be disclosed. The crucial question is whether it is permissible that users on Facebook have no choice.\n",

            " Normality - that's the magic word for Germany's education politicians these days. If it is up to them, schools should return to normal operations after the summer vacation. However, the culture ministers leave this back door open: whether regular operation will be possible depends on the infection process. What exactly does that mean? And if - as is currently the case in the Gütersloh district - schools have to be closed across the board again, is there a Plan B? How are schools preparing for a new possible shutdown? SPIEGEL asked these and other questions to all 16 ministries of education. The reaction: Almost half did not answer at all, others wrote promptly and in detail. Some ministries of culture have already developed clear guidelines for the new school year, others are still advising. The 16 federal states agree that regular instruction should take place again at all primary and secondary schools after the summer holidays: in normal class groups or in fixed groups, with a full schedule. For this, the rule must be that students and teachers keep a distance of 1.50 meters from each other - which is met with massive criticism from teacher associations. Learning in fixed groups that do not meet should reduce the risk of infection and, if the worst comes to the worst, enable the chain of infection to be traced. In Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, this is how it should go in the new school year: \"Classroom instruction takes place in fixed groups, such as classes or courses, to which teaching staff teams are firmly assigned. The hourly table must be adhered to.\" The different groups should not meet each other or should only meet each other with the minimum distance. In order to be able to ventilate rooms well and to ensure that the groups do not meet, the lesson time can be reduced to 40 or 80 minutes. The ministry leaves open how exactly all of this is organized: \"The schools are given as much flexibility as possible when it comes to implementation.\" Stefanie Hubig, President of the Conference of Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs Countries like Berlin and Saarland had already decided before going to the Conference of Education and Ministers of Culture (KMK) on Thursday that they would rely on fixed groups. Ventilate and clean more often - these measures are intended to further reduce the risk of infection in the capital. From Saarbrücken, it is said that exceptions from fixed groups are possible during specialist classes. They are also working on a \"new model hygiene plan\" and a \"pedagogical framework with adapted guidelines for the coming school year, for example on learning content and performance evaluation\". That means: curricula are slimmed down and grades are reconsidered. \"Honesty means that teaching content has to be adjusted,\" said KMK President Stefanie Hubig. Federal Education Minister Anja Karliczek became even clearer at the weekend. She does not believe that she will return to normal school operations after the holidays. \"The virus is not gone, and we have to reckon with the fact that schools have to be closed if someone gets infected there,\" said the CDU politician of the \"Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung\". \"We must continue to act with caution.\" Hamburg is accordingly cautious. \"I am very certain that full regular tuition will take place for grades 1 to 6 after the summer holidays. Full higher tuition is likely for the higher grades, but not quite as secure as for primary school,\" said Education Senator Ties Rabe (SPD) . Therefore, schools should develop alternatives in the event that school operations have to be temporarily restricted. Saxony is also planning regular operations. But \"whether this happens and under what conditions\", the state government wants to make dependent on studies on viral load and antibodies in children from Leipzig and Dresden. Whether regular operation is practically possible also depends on how many colleagues in a school belong to the risk group - and thus possibly drop out for classroom instruction. An evaluation by SPIEGEL shows: In eight federal states, at least one in ten teachers drop out of class in the classroom. In some countries such as Baden-Württemberg, it is even 20 percent. For this reason alone, Prime Minister Winfried Kretschmann (Greens) considers a return to regular operations at schools in Baden-Württemberg to be unrealistic after the summer holidays.

            " \"Our core problem is the high number of teachers and educators who belong to the vulnerable groups,\" said Kretschmann in an interview with the \"Stuttgarter Zeitung\". \"You can't do normal operations like you did before the corona pandemic.\" In Hamburg, a sample showed that up to 30 percent of educators consider themselves unable to go to school because of the health risk. These gaps are difficult to close. In Germany there is a shortage of teachers even without Corona. The Saarland wants at least formally to ensure that educators can be hired. With the supplementary budget, \"an additional corona-related mobile teaching staff reserve with up to 100 full-time positions was created.\" \"I am not a clairvoyant, but if effective health protection measures and clear measures are not taken in the event of renewed outbreaks, school closures are more likely.\" That says Heinz-Peter Meidinger, chairman of the German Teachers' Association. He wants to know what politicians are planning in the event that schools cannot open regularly, depending on the level of infection. In Baden-Württemberg it is said that \"various conceivable scenarios\" are being prepared, but there is still time until September. Hessen refers to a \"concept group\" that still days. Saxony-Anhalt announced: \"In this case, the current mode is used.\" At the primary schools in the state, learning is carried out in the normal class network according to the principle of fixed groups. In secondary schools there is a mix of distance and classroom instruction. This mixed model, in English: blended learning, is also Plan B in Berlin. All schools in the city have received a letter with an \"alternative scenario\" that contains detailed rules and \"minimum standards\": At primary schools, for example, children should spend at least three hours a day Have face-to-face lessons, the weekly schedule must be covered within two weeks. Each school must also develop a concept for how learning can be networked at home and in the classroom. In the future, the following should apply, among other things: \"Teachers have to report to their students at least twice a week and draw up weekly work plans. It is completely different in North Rhine-Westphalia. In the event that regular operations have to be suspended, the Ministry of Education will refer teachers to extensive material collections\" Hints and tips for learning at a distance \". However, these should not be understood as a\" rigid set of rules \", but rather\" provide orientation \". NRW speaks overall of\" flexible guidelines \". To avoid new school closings, federal states such as Bavaria, Baden- Wuerttemberg, Saxony and Berlin, students and teachers to test for an infection. The exact modalities have not yet been determined. Experts believe that regular tests could be a key measure to prevent schools from going into a stop-and-go mode of normalcy and closure. \"With regular screening, you can quickly find out who is infected. At school, you can quickly find out who the person was last in contact with, \"says the virologist Alexander Kekulé. The infected would then be isolated and everyday school life would not be paralyzed for everyone else, so the idea. One thing is certain: face-to-face teaching is once again impossible schoolchildren and teachers should be better prepared for it than at the beginning of the corona crisis. Many schools had to switch to online tuition in mid-March - and this often only worked with moderate success. Even before Corona, the federal states had different positions in terms of digital learning the way they proceed now differs just as much. In Saarland, a specially set up video conference server is to improve online lessons. All teachers are given a school email address. According to the GEW education union, this is not as common as some think. According to this, many educators work with them private accounts Hessen like v Many others offer a nationwide cloud that all schools can use in the new school year, but do not have to. Unlike in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, there are no offers for teachers in Hesse during the holidays to get digitally fit. Bavaria has had a digital education portal for eight years that can be used to organize online lessons. For students and teachers who are still not familiar with the pandemic, there are tutorials and short explanatory videos. If you have any questions, you can contact a telephone hotline. However, teachers like Robert Plötz from Munich complain that the Free State invests too little in professionally created content for online lessons. \"That wouldn't be witchcraft,\" he says. Instead, each teacher searches for suitable material online. Either way, digital learning can only work if all students are equipped with the appropriate technology. This has also been a problem in recent weeks, especially among children from socially disadvantaged families. The government therefore increased the digital pact by 500 million euros to 5.5 billion euros so that schools can purchase rental laptops. However, the devices have by no means reached all students. If you believe the McKinsey management consultants, these additional 500 million do not even cover ten percent of the device costs. According to them, end devices should be purchased for all teachers and students. Background: Teachers should be able to store student data on the devices, which is not allowed on private laptops or tablets. The management consultancy estimates the acquisition costs for the more than 800,000 teachers and eleven million students in Germany at around six billion euros.\n",

            " Passenger numbers have plummeted as never before in aviation history. In May, only 464,245 passengers used German airports - 97.9 percent less than in the previous year. And many people who had booked flights before or during the corona crisis are now having trouble with the airlines. If an actually booked - and paid - flight fails, many passengers wait in vain for their money and instead often only get a voucher offered by the airline. A final judgment by the Nürtingen District Court could now increase the pressure on the airlines - and strengthen customer rights. A passenger complained that he wanted to fly from Stuttgart to Budapest with Eurowings on April 6, 2020. He had already booked the flight directly with the airline in January. After some back and forth - such as announcing a change or postponing the flight - Eurowings canceled the flight entirely and offered the customer a voucher. The customer declined and insisted on the refund of the ticket price. But the Lufthansa subsidiary Eurowings did not want to transfer. The prevented passenger contacted the Hamburg passenger rights portal EUFlight. There was no claim to compensation there, but a refund of the ticket price. For EUFlight, a service provider then sued Eurowings - and won. Without a hearing, the judge sentenced Eurowings to reimburse the ticket price of EUR 75.99. In addition, the airline has to bear the procedural costs, according to the table around 175 euros. The entitlement to full reimbursement of the ticket price results from the Passenger Rights Ordinance. The decision is also based on political developments. The EU had opposed the voucher solution originally brought in by the federal government and is now insisting that a repayment must be made if the customer so wishes. Many airlines and tour operators criticize the EU's stance because they lose liquidity if they have to repay customer funds quickly. In this specific case, Eurowings confirms that the request for reimbursement was initially rejected and that the customer was offered a voucher or a rebooking instead. This is justified by the effects of the corona crisis. A spokesman says the pandemic \"has almost completely stopped air traffic\". The virus crisis had \"at times not been able to transport several million travelers as originally planned\". This has a \"historically high number of customer cases and reimbursement requests\". At the time the flight was canceled, there had been no final decision on a voucher refund from the European Union (EU). The voucher solution was considered \"sensible and fair\" at this point in time, because it \"gave the airlines some air to breathe in this difficult situation and at the same time the demands of customers\" were met. But now take into account \"the final decision of the EU on the vouchers\" and comply with the reimbursement requests of Eurowings customers - even if the voucher solution is gratefully accepted by a large number of customers. The airline also asks for understanding that the processing of reimbursement applications \"may be delayed\". EUflight managing director Lars Watermann is naturally happy about the judgment. \"It is to be welcomed that the court is strengthening consumer rights and forcing the airline to repay it. The fact that Eurowings did not reply to the complaint proves that the airline managers know very well that they are repaying by law would be obliged, \"he says. Customers who demanded their right were apparently perceived as a nuisance by the airlines. \"Airlines are less sensitive if their survival is to be secured with taxpayer money. There is a considerable need for correction here,\" says Watermann.\n",

            " The corona pandemic is also plunging the German economy into a crisis. Many companies are already feeling it. In order not to have to dismiss their employees, they now send them in short-time work. Employees then receive money from unemployment insurance - in principle also at this level: 60 percent of the net wage, employees with children in the household 67 percent. However, not every employee is fully committed to short-time work. It is possible (and also customary) that short-time workers still work part of the agreed working hours. You will then continue to receive a corresponding share of the wages from the employer. In the event of loss of earnings, they then receive short-time work benefits - 60 or 67 percent of the amount that they lack for their normal net wages. How much that is concrete is difficult to calculate depending on the case. With our short-time work allowance calculator, you can quickly and easily calculate how much income you can expect in your specific case. In order to be able to use the calculator, you must first enter your regular gross monthly salary (in the \"Gross gross wage target\" field), then the gross monthly salary that you also receive from your employer during short-time work (in the \"Gross gross wage actual\" field) . If you work with so-called short-time work, zero - so don't work at all anymore - your actual gross salary will also be zero euros. If your working time is halved, your actual gross salary will also be halved. You also have to specify whether children live in your household - and which state you live in. The latter is necessary because different contribution limits apply to East and West Germany. If your gross salary with short-time work is still above this limit, no short-time work benefit will be paid. Then you need to know your income tax class. Here is a brief overview of which class you belong to: Income tax class I applies to the following employees: single widows from the year after next after the death of their spouse or registered partner, divorced married or living in a partnership who are permanently separated or married whose spouse or registered partner is only subject to limited taxation in the Federal Republic (usually because he or she does not live in Germany) Wage tax class II applies to single parents who meet the requirements of tax class I and who are also entitled to the relief amount for single parents to have. The following employees fall into income tax class III: Married and registered partners who do not live separately forever and have not chosen tax class IV. The spouse or life partner who is also employed then receives tax class V. If the other partner is not employed or self-employed, wage tax class III also applies to him. Widowed until the end of the calendar year following the death of the spouse / partner. The deceased spouse or life partner must have been subject to unlimited income tax at the time of his death. The spouses or life partners must not have lived separately until the time of death. Married employees or those living in partnership fall into income tax class IV if both partners are subject to unlimited income tax and do not permanently live separately. However, if one partner is in tax class III, the other does not fall in tax class IV, but in tax class V. Spouses or life partners who are both employed can have the tax class changed once a year. Tax class V is applied if both spouses or life partners apply to classify the other spouse or life partner in tax class III (see above). Income tax class VI is usually entered if an employee has more than one employment relationship.\n",

            " Recently, the SPD leader Saskia Esken was heavily scolded (by almost all political parties, but also by ministers of the interior and by police unions anyway) because she refused to accept racism as an individual pathology in the police. This violated a dogma: When the police speak of \"racism\" and \"police violence\", attributions such as \"isolated cases\" and \"black sheep\" are usually not long in coming. This is a conventional but wrong reaction. Even if the individual cases increase in concern, there is no connection to the structure or culture of the police force if these individual cases are not demonstrably connected. And a staff of around 270,000 police officers offers plenty of scope for individual cases. I have a rhetorical question to the apologists on a case-by-case basis: From what number would you speak of a multitude, a plurality, or a structure? And what would you count? Racist statements, symbols, actions? Or also excessive use of force? Or also insults, ludicrous behavior, imperious behavior? We get from stick to stick and quickly lose track. I advocate no longer talking about loss-making individuals, but rather analyzing situations and systems comprehensively, i.e. the circumstances and the organizational and cultural environment. Because the repeatedly tried thesis of the (few) individual cases starts from the idea that there are a few, quasi monadic, in the organization, without contacts, without connections to colleagues, especially without knowledge of the mistakes of others . The narrative of general suspicion and the moral outrage that one is extreme can only survive to the extent that one maintains that people are what they are, quasi inherently good or not. This narrative is often supplemented by the metaphor of the (again few) \"black sheep\", which are implicitly opposed by the (thought but not said: many) white sheep. This puts immense pressure on the \"white sheep\" because they must never do anything that is attributed to the black sheep, otherwise they are also. born 1958, 15 years as a police officer in Hesse, then studied sociology and psychoanalysis in Frankfurt. After teaching in Güstrow, doctoral thesis on \"Cop Culture - the everyday life of the monopoly on violence\" in 1999. Thereafter teaching and research in Frankfurt am Main, Nienburg and Hamburg. Since 2008 professor for police science at the University of the Academy of Police Hamburg. Head of the research center \"Culture and Security\" (FOKuS). However, this dichotomy does not reflect the everyday life of the police. There are quite a few who misbehave, the many who behave impeccably. Rather, everyone can find themselves in a situation in which they violate police standards in very different ways. Something has happened to anyone who has experienced police work that they are ashamed of and are glad that it was either not noticed or, if it was noticed, that it was treated discretely. This is one of the main functions of the \"Code of Silence\" or the \"Wall of Silence\" in cop culture. The wall does not primarily protect monstrous acts and violent criminals in the police, but primarily protects the (mostly) white sheep from having to change color publicly. The cop culture's promise of discretion regulates the everyday life of the police, not its extremes. Even more precisely: the line between \"normality\" and \"exception\" cannot be drawn precisely and protection fails if solidarity is \"absolutely\" valid and is not subject to conditions. The principle from the cop culture \"Unconditional solidarity applies to the service\" is at the same time functional and a space for transgressions of any kind. We tried to replace this principle in a long reform process with the Austrian police by saying: \"Our solidarity has there their limits where members of our organization violate applicable law or deviate sustainably from the objective and principles \"(orientation sentence 15, to be found here). To stay in the image of the sheep: I would like to modify the metaphor. It can happen to any sheep to temporarily change color. Therefore, both acts of aggression and ideological radicalization must be thought of out of the situation and the systems surrounding it, not as an anthropological constant. I have no doubt that there are bad people, including the police. But for most of them this does not seem to be a genetic defect, but rather the result of attribution processes, frustration and deprivation experiences, real and / or subjective insults, unprocessed conflicts etc. And no, it does not happen to everyone with the same probability. And not everyone reacts in the same way. More details have yet to be researched, but that has been prevented up to now. Instead, one sticks almost stubbornly to the idea of ​​\"individual cases\". When the so-called \"police study\" was commissioned in Hessen in 2019, many hoped for a big hit, but the only thing that came to a sensational conclusion was that the \"(d) democratic values ​​were firmly anchored in the Hessian police \"are - which nobody seriously doubted anyway. At the same time, one did not forget to mention that police officers were also victims of violence. Instead of such ministerial \"contract research\", those responsible in ministries and authorities should finally have the courage to allow independent research and advice that is not limited to individual violence control and racism prevention, but that can deal extensively with the human rights guarantee in the police force. The aim of such a process would be to create a culture of attention and to strengthen those who are around those colleagues who have already been noticed as racist and / or violent. It would have to be ensured that the louder became louder and the unfair again quieter. But that doesn't work with the bulwark of outrage and delegitimization that is activated every time criticism is given or the word \"latent\" is used when it comes to the structural conditions of racism and violence. You can only answer whether there is latent racism in the police force once you have agreed on the meaning of the word. The nasty thing about latency is that it is not revealed, otherwise Ms. Esken would have spoken of \"manifest racism\". In both directions, it is an indefinable term. But I also assume that there are many more \"right\" ideas in the police force, but much of it remains informal. At this point you will find an external content that complements the article.

            " It takes humility and recognition that \"evil\" (here: abuse of violence and racism) is indeed over-individual. But the closer you as an organization amalgamate yourself to \"evil\", the harder it is. The police officers know that they (have to) expect their officers not only to refrain from doing evil, but to put an end to it, to connect with him. That is why I count the police, together with the Church, among the highly moral organizations. In 2018, Hildesheim's Bishop Heiner Wilmer pointed out the background of sexual violence in the Catholic Church with his famous phrase \"... the abuse of power is in the DNA of the church\", thus creating a violent controversy in the church. Wilmer spoke in the same context of a \"structure of evil\" in the church. Where the good is actually supposed to be produced and preserved, there is also its opposite, evil or, in the case of the church, sin. Wilmer not only locates the \"evil\" among the faithful and touches the church not only in confessional talks but also within the priesthood. Wilmer avoids speaking of individual \"lost souls\". He talks about his organization. It doesn't mean that the church as a whole is evil or abuse of power (nor does it mean, in the case of the police, that it is generally violent or racist). Rather, it points to the institutional link between one and the other. And then the customization no longer works. The basic ethical problem of the police is very similar: they too want the good, and they stand up for creating or defending it. However, the church and the police have to struggle with the enforcement of the claim as well as with the prevention of the opposite by their own staff, and they have tabooed this for a long time. I call both organizations highly moral because their job is not only to refrain from doing evil, but to work directly on the border between good and evil and to ensure that this border is not exceeded. And more: you have to connect with \"evil\" in order to fulfill your calling: the priest with sin (and sinners), policewoman with \"crimen\" or other phenomena contrary to \"good policey\". For the police, this problem affects, for example, the problem of drawing their own violence. I also call the police highly moral because it requires a comprehensive ethical framework to do things that look like destructive violence, but that are legally or also in the sense of serving the purpose of general peacekeeping. If you think in the categories that Bishop Wilmer has shown, the abuse of power is not just or not just the delinquent or pathological mistake of individual criminals / confused or racists, but it is embedded as it were in the police logic of action, so to speak (as an excess of violence, as provoked violence). The reflexive reference to individual cases should serve to ignore the structural conditions of the issue of violence and to pretend that there is an overwhelming majority of lawless officials (who never abused violence) and a (small) minority of blacks Sheep in the police. This inability to give up binary thinking seems to me to be the real problem of the police dealing with the issue of violence (and here the Hildesheim bishop is a step ahead of the police and probably also of his own church). The institutional refusal to deal with the subject of abuse of violence creates greater problems than the concrete abuse of violence (this also applies to dealing with extreme right-wing attitudes, radicalization and other forms of morally questionable behavior). The example of violence is intended to show how hard the organization has to try to legitimize its actions morally. If this does not succeed, it would be morally on the same level as those whose violence it is intended to prevent or subdue. If you adopt this perspective, it is no longer very difficult to draw a latent connection between violence and racism or racially motivated discrimination. Both undermine belief in the moral integrity of the police because it pretends not to be a problem where others see a lot of problems. When an organization does not strive to create structures that effectively prevent or minimize excess violence, radicalization and racism, or at least contribute to it, I call it a structural obstacle to education. And that's almost as bad as structural racism.\n",

            " Because of his sick brother, Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI. traveled to Bavaria. A visit that obviously demands a lot from him. The 93-year-old was very exhausted, said Clemens Neck, spokesman for the diocese of Regensburg, citing Benedikt's private secretary Georg Gänswein. The journey and the absence of the usual daily routine exert him. But he was incredibly happy to see his 96-year-old brother Georg Ratzinger. The ex-Pope, born Joseph Ratzinger, had surprisingly arrived in Regensburg on Thursday to see his sick brother again. Georg Ratzinger, the long-time director of the Regensburger Domspatzen, had waited so impatiently for the arrival of his younger brother that he pressed his alarm clock every few minutes to have the time announced. Neck said, citing Georg Ratzinger's housekeeper, Sister Laurente. The 96-year-old is almost completely blind and currently so sick that he is bedridden. On Friday morning, Benedikt drove out of the seminary in Regensburg, where he currently lives, to his brother's house nearby. There the brothers celebrated a mass together. According to ear witnesses, the singing could be heard outside on the street. For lunch it should go back to the seminary. According to diocese spokesman Neck Apfelstrudel was on the menu. How long the visit to Regensburg should last is unclear. There are still no concrete plans for a return trip to Rome, it said. Benedikt has lived there in a monastery in the Vatican Gardens since his retirement in 2013. From diocese circles it could be heard that it was rather a short visit and that the younger Ratzinger brother could leave in a few days.\n",

            " Three months after the fatal police shots on African American Breonna Taylor in her own apartment, one of the officers involved is released. The Mayor of Louisville, Kentucky, Greg Fischer, said on Friday that the procedure to fire police officer Brett Hankison had begun. He could not provide any further information due to legal regulations. The release of the police officer was announced just on the \"Juneteenth\" memorial day, which commemorates the end of slavery in the United States in 1865. Given the nationwide protests against racism and police violence against blacks, the day was particularly important this year. Taylor's death in mid-March had caused outrage. White plainclothes officers stormed Taylor's apartment during a night drug raid while the 26-year-old paramedic and her boyfriend were sleeping. Taylor's friend believed his raid to be a raid and opened the fire with a weapon that he legitimately owned. In the subsequent exchange of fire, Taylor was hit by at least eight bullets. The police had a search warrant that allowed them to storm the apartment unannounced. However, they affirmed that they knocked several times before opening the door with a battering ram. The lawyers of Taylor's family deny this. No drugs were found during the search. The police officers have so far remained undisturbed. A few days ago, pop star Beyoncé called for consequences for the officials. Taylor's death is part of a series of deadly police operations against blacks in the United States. The death of African-American George Floyd in a brutal police operation in the city of Minneapolis in May sparked nationwide protests and led to calls for far-reaching police reforms. Note: In a first version of this message, it was said that one of the police officers was released - in fact, he was released. We corrected the mistake.\n",

            " A sunny July morning in 1980 on a country road north of Stuttgart. Fresh bread rolls smell on the back seat of the Golf GLS. The 28-year-old driver is probably tired. In a curve it gets on the opposite lane and bangs head-on into a gravel truck. You and your passenger die. The police find weapons, fake ID cards and thousand dollar bills from the ransom of a kidnapping in the wreck. The Golf has been stolen, the French license plates have been faked. It is an accident at work by the RAF terrorist group. He will have episodes two years later that no one suspects this summer morning. The two casualties had a conspiratorial apartment in Heidelberg. Despite an intensive search, it was only found in October 1980 when the main tenant returned from abroad and wanted to question her missing subtenants about the spoiled food. Apparently no one had been in the apartment since the accident. The most valuable evidence should be sheets with encrypted notes. It remained puzzling why the RAF did not \"clean\" the apartment as usual, ie emptied and cleaned it flawlessly, including removing fingerprints.

            " Immediately before the important general meeting of Lufthansa on Thursday, there is still no agreement on possible savings contributions by the staff. As of Wednesday afternoon, there was no jointly signed statement by the company, the flight attendants' union UFO and the Cockpit Association, spokesmen said in Frankfurt. In any case, Verdi only plans to continue negotiating with the ground staff on Friday. At the extraordinary general meeting on Thursday, the shareholders will decide on a federal capital participation and thus also on the associated rescue package of nine billion euros. The largest Lufthansa shareholder, the billionaire and industrialist Heinz Hermann Thiele, can block the state participation with his shares of 15.52 percent. In this case, Lufthansa has announced to the shareholders that it will apply for a protective shield procedure as soon as possible. However, Lufthansa should have an alternative plan in the event that the government bailout fails. In this way, the federal government could come to the proposed share participation of 20 percent even without the consent of the other shareholders, as leaked from corporate circles. Should there be a blockade, Lufthansa could provide the federal government with a share of around ten percent from authorized capital without the shareholders' consent. The state would acquire another ten percent in the course of one or two regular capital increases, in which the other shareholders could also participate. A Lufthansa spokesman declined to comment on this scenario. It also remained open whether the federal government would accept the higher price for the share package. The cabin union Ufo had reported a good level of negotiation in terms of personnel contributions, which still had to be fixed in writing. The union's goal is to protect employment for four years. In order to reduce personnel costs, redundancy payments, early retirement and collective savings for flight attendants were discussed. Ufo managing director Nicoley Baublies put the flight attendant's savings contribution at around 700 million euros within four years. Cockpit had offered 350 million euros. The corporation, which was hit hard by the Corona crisis, put the global headcount at 22,000 jobs due to the persistently lower demand. Around 11,000 of these are in Germany. Measures are now to be agreed in the negotiations to keep as many employees as possible on board. These include, for example, extended part-time models and the waiver of salary increases and allowances.\n",

            " Minister of Labor Hubertus Heil wants to take action against the grievances in the meat industry with a ban on contracts for work no later than January 1, the Federal Cabinet recently agreed. After the massive corona outbreak at Germany's largest meat company Tönnies, the protection of employees is now the focus of criticism. The SPD politician has therefore called for faster steps to protect meat workers. \"We want to tighten controls even before the new occupational safety law in the meat industry is in place,\" Heil told the editorial network in Germany. It could take a few months before the new law against the abuse of work contracts. \"We are working with several ministries to make the ban legally certain,\" said Heil, but promised to be \"serious about the ban on contracts for work in the core area of ​​the meat industry\". He was also in \"very productive talks with the countries\". The draft law should be available in summer. The Gütersloh district, in whose area Tönnies is located, had recently ordered quarantine for all employees in Rheda-Wiedenbrück - also against the controversial CEO Clemens Tönnies. There is a power struggle in the family business, including public resignation demands. The public prosecutor's office investigated criminal complaints, and numerous Bundeswehr soldiers were supposed to help conduct corona tests on the company's premises. Minister of Labor Heil: tighten controls even before the amendment to the law After the incident, the chairman of the Greens parliamentary group, Anton Hofreiter, called on the SPD and the Union to bring the planned restrictions on contracts for work into parliament as early as next week. \"The government has so far protected the business model of cheap meat producers at the expense of health,\" said the Greens politician of the \"Passauer Neue Presse\". Hofreiter criticized the \"scandalous\" working conditions in the meat industry. The living situation of the employees is \"irresponsible\". \"The system cannot go on like this,\" he said - and requested reviews of all slaughterhouses. \"In addition to the general occupational safety standards, they have to improve the climatic conditions in the slaughterhouses,\" said Hofreiter. Temperature and humidity would have to be optimized and air exchange improved. \"Only if the slaughterhouses prove these conditions can they be put back into operation.\" The state government of North Rhine-Westphalia must finally clean up and should not give the employees the responsibility for the latest Corona outbreak. If the full-time employees come from Eastern Europe, they also earn hundreds of euros less per month compared to their German colleagues, according to the Federal Employment Agency (BA). According to the BA, the median income for German colleagues at the end of 2018 was around € 2,300 gross per month, for Romanian employees around 1,800, for Bulgarians around 1,700 and for Poland and Hungary around 1,900 and just under € 2,000, according to data from BA emerges, which were published in the Bundestag at the request of the left faction. Its labor market policy spokeswoman Sabine Zimmermann said that if the wages were already low in the officially registered figures in the field of full-time employment, \"what are the conditions like only in the gray areas of construction contracts, subcontractors, bogus self-employed and fake hourly statements to circumvent the minimum wage?\" In many cases it is \"pure exploitation\". The North Rhine-Westphalian State Cabinet plans to deal with the Corona outbreak at Tönnies in a special session on Sunday. There the state government will assess the situation again, said CDU Prime Minister Armin Laschet. Federal Minister of Health Jens Spahn and Minister of Defense Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer (both CDU) had agreed to provide as much staff as required. \"Everything that is necessary is done - also with the support of the federal government.\" The outbreak at Tönnies has serious consequences for the entire region. Thousands are in official quarantine, 803 tests related to the outbreak at Tönnies have already been positive. The NRW Prime Minister Laschet no longer rules out a regional lockdown. The massive infection process can still be localized, said Laschet. \"If this changes, a comprehensive lockdown in the region may also be necessary.\" According to the district, 3,500 tests have now been carried out at the Tönnies company, including Friday 1450 alone. The problem is that the employees lived in a larger catchment area - also in Warendorf, Soest, Bielefeld, Hamm and other places. The outbreak is already having serious consequences: schools and daycare centers in the district are dense again, and the population is growing angry about it.\n",

            " Siegfried seems to grin as he swims. He raised his nostrils and bared his teeth - as if he had nothing but contempt for the dangerous situation. But that's a purely human perspective. Like all horses, he instinctively does this so that no water runs into his nostrils. Jan Mohnhaupt, born in 1983, is a freelance journalist and non-fiction author. His work \"The Zoo of Others\", published in 2017, on the animal arms race between the Federal Republic and the GDR has been translated into several languages. \"Animals in National Socialism\" (2020) is Mohnhaupt's third book. Siegfried is an approximately seven year old fox-colored Trakehner. His rider, the Dresdener Max Kuhnert, is a scout in the rider platoon of the 432nd Infantry Regiment, which was commanded on the banks of the Western Bug in June 1941. The river forms the border between the areas occupied by the Germans and those of the Soviet Union. Up to this point and no further, Adolf Hitler and Josef Stalin had agreed when they made their non-aggression pact in 1939. But on June 22, 1941, Hitler had the long-planned \"Barbarossa Company\" begin, the attack on the Soviet Union. Three million soldiers are ready, equipped with 1,800 aircraft, 3,600 tanks, 7,000 guns, 600,000 motor vehicles - and 750,000 horses. Regiment 432 is one of the first to cross the bow. Since the hastily erected pontoon bridge has long been under constant fire, Kuhnert has no choice but to swim over with Siegfried. Nazi propaganda tries to present the war of aggression as a motorized, high-tech undertaking. But the reality is different: there were horses on every front, whether in the west or east. But especially on the Eastern Front, there is no progress without horses. Because there are not enough motorized vehicles and fuel to bring weapons and provisions to the front as reliably and quickly as is possible with horses. A total of almost three million horses, donkeys and mules are sent to war on the German side. Never before and never again have animals played such a decisive role in German history as in the \"Third Reich\". They have been of importance in all areas of life, whether in war, everyday life or in propaganda. And the horse plays a special role in this. Because while the National Socialists like to compare themselves to wolves and give their tanks the names of big cats, it is the only herbivore, the only escape animal that is worshiped alongside all these predators. Hunted, revered, used: animals under National Socialism This is shown not least in the Nazi art, which is rich in horse motifs - be it long-legged mounts that carry their soldiers over all obstacles, or massive arable pillars that indifferently the floe at home plow up. In the Nazi iconography, the horse stands for strength and willingness to make sacrifices without appearing submissive. Even if Adolf Hitler is fond of dogs and worships the wolf, he can hardly get enough of horses. He had two of his larger-than-life horse statues in classic style created by one of his favorite sculptors, Josef Thorak, in the garden of the New Reich Chancellery in Berlin. But Hitler's hippophilia is limited to works of art. He avoids any direct contact with living specimens; he detests them and thinks they're stupid. Like \"the Russian,\" Hitler raves, the horse would \"throw away all upbringing\" in an instant if it were not kept in check. He doesn't think much of the cavalry either. The classic cavalry has gradually had its day. However, the horse remains indispensable as a load carrier, draft horse and mount for messengers and scouts. It started raining at the beginning of September 1941. So violent and persistent that the puddles no longer dry, continue to grow and the ground softens to the depth. Motorbikes and motor vehicles get stuck in rows in the mud, the advance stalls. Only the horses continue to pull the carts out of the dirt, even though they have long since sunk to their belly in the mud. The cold follows the mud. Rivers freeze, the engines fail and Siegfried's warm breath freezes in the air to ice crystals. Price inquiry time June 26th, 2020 3:40 am No guarantee The joint path of Max Kuhnert and Siegfried ends somewhere in the wasteland of West Russia in the spring of 1942. In an attack, Siegfried is seriously injured by a shrapnel. Kuhnert has to watch helplessly as he bled to death. \"For me he was not just a horse,\" he later wrote in his English memoir \"Will We See Tomorrow? A German Cavalryman at War (1939.1942)\". \"He was my best friend.\" The fate of horses concerns many soldiers. In numerous field post letters they describe their suffering and death: \"Torn from grenades, inflated, eyes popped out of empty red caves, standing and trembling, slowly but steadily bleeding from a small hole in the chest - that's how we see them now Months, \"writes one. \"It's almost worse than the torn faces of people.\" But the longer the war lasts, the more often the \"comrade horse\" is fatal to his own combatants. Nowhere is this more evident than in Stalingrad. The 6th German army, which is supposed to occupy the industrial city on the Volga, is hopelessly underserved. In November 1942, the Red Army managed to encircle them. A quarter of a million soldiers are now trapped - with them 52,000 horses and mules. With continued isolation, more and more animals are moving into their own pots. \"As long as we still have horses, it will work, and besides, the Fiihrer will not leave us,\" writes a German soldier full of hope shortly before Christmas 1942. But Hitler demands that the soldiers persevere and break the encirclement on their own, which fails . In order to keep the soldiers alive, 4,000 horses of the allied Romanian cavalry are slaughtered and processed into meat soup. \"The last horse has been eaten up for a long time and no idea when the shit will end,\" writes a soldier in mid-January 1943. When the half-frozen and starved 6th Army surrendered in the ruins of Stalingrad two weeks later, there were originally 250,000 German soldiers trapped 90,000 still alive. None of her 52,000 horses come out alive. They were all frozen to death, died on the battlefield, or eaten. How far the shadow of Stalingrad still extends and how emotionally we are still connected to the horse was last seen in spring 2013: in several European countries, supposed beef products appeared in supermarkets at that time, which actually consisted largely of horse meat. An outcry went through the country. However, there is no \"little girl hysteria\" behind it, but historical experience, wrote the daily newspaper \"Die Welt\": \"Nowhere is the disgust for horse meat as pronounced as in the generation that still experienced the Second World War and the post-war years.\" Cultural historian Peter Peter also saw \"an unpleasant memory, especially among older people\" - in \"emergency slaughter of horses, in Stalingrad pictures\".\n",

            " Till Kreutzer is pissed off. The copyright expert from IGEL, the \"Initiative against an ancillary copyright\", calls a \"huge mess\" what is currently happening around the implementation of the EU copyright directive in Germany. A while ago, the Federal Ministry of Justice (BMJV) sent a first draft bill to the other ministries involved. It makes suggestions as to how at least some parts of the directive could be implemented in German law. But Kreutzer received two letters from CDU-led houses that spoiled his mood. The first comes from the Federal Ministry of Economics (BMWi), the second from the Federal Chancellery, both are addressed to the SPD-led Ministry of Justice. The BMWi formulates \"red lines\", as it says in the letter, which, if exceeded, the ministry will block the BMJV's proposal. One of these red lines relates to the proposed ancillary copyright law: Under what conditions can a search engine operator like Google link to press products on the Internet, and in which cases does he need a license from the rights holder - for which he might have to pay? In the directive adopted in 2019, Article 15 states, among other things, that the ancillary copyright for publishers does not apply if only the pure hyperlink is set and not \"for the use of individual words or very short extracts from a press release\". The German ancillary copyright law for press publishers, which the European Court of Justice conceded in 2019, already contains such a wording, on the limits of which there was never an agreement. In order to draw a concrete limit for the permitted length of the so-called snippets on the one hand and to allow scope for exceptional cases on the other hand, the BMJV proposed in its draft the wording \"generally not more than eight words\". The BMWi claims to have deleted it completely because it \"restricts the rights of press publishers too much\". Instead, the directive text should be adopted word for word at this point. The other letter also refers to Article 15. The Chancellery demands the deletion of a single word from a draft wording of the BMJV: From the sentence \"A press publisher has the exclusive right to publish all or part of his press release for online use by providers of To make services of the information society publicly available and to reproduce them \"the word\" on this \"should disappear. The consequence would be that search engine operators need licenses from publishers even if they only include their products in their search index - regardless of whether and to what extent they make this so-called index copy accessible to their users. Kreutzer says: \"That would mean, for example, that search engines cannot simply shorten the snippets to avoid the 'performance protection money'. To achieve this, they would have to completely list press products.\" That in turn, he believes, should be banned from Google \"for antitrust reasons\", which would ultimately force the US company to link press products and pay license fees to publishers. Julia Reda from the Society for Freedom Rights, who worked intensively on copyright reform as a MEP, is also disappointed. She told SPIEGEL: \"The demands of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Chancellery read as if they came directly from the pen of the chief lobbyist of Axel Springer.\" The publisher is the largest advocate of ancillary copyright. Another requirement of the BMWi is the deletion of the profit sharing provided by the actual authors in the draft speaker. Journalists and authors, for example, should receive \"appropriate\" shares of the income from ancillary copyright law, the directive already says. The BMJV had proposed at least a third - the BMWi, on the other hand, does not want any definition \"so as not to restrict the private autonomy of the parties\". The BMJV also intended to limit the amount of publisher participation in collecting societies such as VG Wort to a maximum of one third, thereby guaranteeing the authors at least two thirds. The publishers are currently not entitled to a participation. Here, too, the BMWi demands that all specific requirements be deleted. Till Kreutzer believes that this would lead to years of controversy between authors and collecting societies and publishers' associations, especially at the expense of freelance journalists: \"With these demands, the march is that the CDU is pushing ahead with copyright reform primarily because it is helping creative people in this country want to help get a better income, unmasked. \" Reda sees it the same way: \"The CDU also wants to deliver the creative to the knife.\" In particular, \"a publisher participation without a legally guaranteed portion of the remuneration for authors\" reveals that exploitation by the publishers, says Reda, because the publishers \"are always on the longer lever in negotiations\". The BMJV only announced that the two letters were \"known\" here, otherwise they did not want to comment on the government's internal vote. The BMWi does not want to comment on its letter to the BMJV either. The Ministry informed the SPIEGEL: \"The BMWi does not comment on any internal letters or ongoing departmental coordination.\"\n",

According to the message, the young man was said to have kicked a student already lying on the ground during the riot in the city center. The authorities write that he at least accepted the possible death of the student. The student is said to have previously verbally criticized the riots and was then beaten up by a group of people. In total, arrest warrants were filed against seven alleged rioters on Monday, one arrest warrant had already been issued on Sunday evening and another had been suspended under certain conditions. According to the police, the suspects are between 16 and 33 years old and have German, Croatian, Iraqi, Portuguese and Latvian citizenship. They are accused of breaching the peace, as well as dangerous bodily harm, physical attacks on enforcement officers and theft in particularly serious cases. Another 16 suspected parties initially arrested were released, it was said. In the night of Sunday, hundreds of people had moved through Stuttgart's central shopping street, destroyed shop windows and looted shops. According to the police, 400 to 500 people were involved in the riot. Baden-Württemberg's Interior Minister Thomas Strobl wants to take decisive action against rioters. Federal Interior Minister Seehofer supports the plan and called for a \"hard punishment\" for perpetrators. Seehofer described the riots in Stuttgart as an \"alarm signal for the rule of law\". He expected the judiciary to issue a \"severe punishment\" against the perpetrators involved, he said. \"Penalties are always the best means of prevention to avoid this in the future.\"\n",

            " At Lufthansa, there is still no agreement on staff savings measures. The company announced that negotiations with the unions Ufo and Vereinigung Cockpit will continue to be intensive in order to find a solution before the extraordinary general meeting this Thursday. The talks were originally scheduled to be completed on Monday. However, the union responsible for ground personnel Ver.di does not want to continue negotiating until Friday, and thus after the shareholders' meeting. At the Annual General Meeting, shareholders decide on a federal government equity participation, which is on the brink due to the increasing influence of major shareholder Heinz Hermann Thiele. He already holds at least 15.5 percent of the troubled company - and has left it open whether he will vote for the rescue plan. Since only a few shareholders have registered for the meeting, a two-thirds majority is necessary for the vote, according to Lufthansa - and according to the group, according to the \"recent statements by important shareholders, especially regarding the terms of the capital increase, it is not certain\". According to a spokesman, the company and the unions had agreed at the beginning of June to \"agree on concrete measures to reduce personnel costs for the period of the crisis by June 22\". It is unclear what consequences the still unsuccessful agreement between employer and unions will have on approval for the nine billion euro state rescue. The shares fell by 1.2 percent on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. Lufthansa employs 138,000 people worldwide. The corporation was hit hard by the corona crisis. Due to the persistently lower demand, he says he has a global workforce of 22,000 jobs. Around 11,000 of these are in Germany. According to the unions, workers are ready to make a contribution to the crisis; the pilots, for example, had offered a waiver of up to 45 percent. In return, the unions demand protection against dismissal. Measures are now to be agreed in the negotiations to keep as many employees as possible on board. These include, for example, extended part-time models and the waiver of salary increases and allowances.\n",

            " Long before the corona pandemic made the home office modern, actor Sean Connery put the concept into practice: He partially shot his last James Bond film \"Never Say Never\" (1983) in-house. At that time, Connery also lived privately like Agent 007, which he embodied in the Bond films. At least that is what pictures from the luxury property \"Le Roc Fleuri\" (\"The Flowering Rock\") suggest, which have now been published. Sean Connery in \"James Bond 007 - Never Never Say\" (1983) But apparently Connery, who turns 90 in August, no longer has any use for the villa on the coast of southern France today. A brokerage company takes care of the sale, according to media reports, the asking price is around 30 million euros. Connery acquired the property in 1970 after marrying Micheline Roquebrune from France. The property offers some luxury for this: the extravagant villa has around 1000 square meters of living space, 5000 square meters of garden are added, and the view looks out onto the Côte d’Azur. There are several pools and large salons with adjacent terraces. \"There are numerous features that would also show the destinations where James Bond resided,\" says the sales brochure, according to People. Sean Connery's villa is for sale Located in the upscale neighborhood of Cap de Nice near Nice, not only is the property itself exceptional. The neighborhood could also have some surprises in store. Stars like Coco Chanel, Pablo Picasso or Grace Kelly once lived here. Sean Connery has become quiet in recent years, his last film was made in 2003 by the Academy Award winner. Connery's wife, Micheline Roquebrune, recently made the headlines. She was accused of tax evasion and illegal property deals - the Connerys had sold a villa in southern Spain. The building was then demolished and the property rebuilt. More than 70 luxury apartments were created on the site. The approval for this should obviously not have been granted. The Connery wife is accused of providing false information to deceive the Treasury.\n",

            " Actually, Thursday of this week should have been the day of the liberation for Wirecard: The payment service provider from Aschheim near Munich, which has been a member of the most important German stock index Dax since autumn 2018, has been suspected for years of hairdressing its balance sheets and pretending deals and business partners. After a special report by KPMG's auditors identified enormous supervisory deficiencies in the group, but on the other hand could not substantiate that there was anything in the allegations against Wirecard, the company should have presented its 2019 balance sheet on Thursday. Their presentation had been postponed several times due to the KPMG report. So when the financial world wanted to address the long-awaited balance sheet in the morning, which was supposed to clarify everything, the company suddenly announced that this would not happen because the auditor EY missed the proof of alleged bank balances of 1.9 billion euros and that Cannot therefore audit the annual report. This was followed by a historic drop in the Wirecard share of more than 60 percent, which continued on Friday - as well as a total loss for the German financial center. Wirecard sees itself as a victim and has filed a complaint against unknown persons. The management of the group assumes that it may have been cheated out of the missing 1.9 billion euros. But there is also a huge crash internally. Jan Marsalek, one of the company's four board members, was initially released on Thursday. On Friday, the long-time CEO Markus Braun announced his immediate resignation. Meanwhile, two Filipino banks have spoken, and Wirecard has reportedly maintained the trustee accounts in question, which lack the 1.9 billion euros. \"Wirecard is not a customer of ours,\" said BDO Unibank and the Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI) in two separate communications. BPI stated that documents that external Wirecard auditors had submitted were forged. The case will be investigated further. BDO said that papers that were supposed to confirm a Wirecard account with the bank had false signatures from bank representatives. Wirecard itself announced on Thursday that loans of around two billion euros could be canceled this Friday if EY did not testify its annual financial statements later in the day. This is an unusually transparent announcement by the group, which is known for its lack of transparency. This could be due to clauses in the loan agreements that force banks to request loans back if a company does not provide a certified balance sheet. It can be assumed that the two billion euros do not mean the actual volume of the loans to Wirecard, but the amount of the so-called credit line up to which Wirecard can take out loans. In other words, it is quite likely that the loan volume will be slightly less than two billion euros. Some time ago the company issued a bond and agreed to cooperate with the Japanese investor Softbank; both have given him fresh liquidity. Experts estimate that the loan is worth 900 million euros and is spread across around 15 banks. A credit default would be manageable for every single bank. On the other hand, a termination of all loans would probably drive Wirecard directly into bankruptcy, and the money would be largely lost for the banks. To prevent this, they could suspend the clauses in the loan agreements or require more collateral and let the loans continue to run. But it would also be just a hope that the missing 1.9 billion euros will reappear, Wirecard's business will continue and the company will service its loans. For long-term cooperation with the banks, however, all of this is a menace. Wirecard announced on Friday that it was in constructive talks with the lending banks regarding the continuation of the credit lines and the further business relationship. The most visible sign of how dangerous the situation is for Wirecard is the crash of the recently issued Wirecard bond. It is now trading at less than half of its face value - lower than, for example, a dollar bond issued by Venezuela's crisis country. This can happen, but is unlikely in the short term. The criteria for membership in the Dax are clear: A company must leave the Dax if it no longer belongs to the top 40 companies in terms of market value and share trading turnover at the regular review date - the next is in September. As of Thursday evening, Wirecard still managed to meet both criteria, above all trade turnover. If a company is no longer one of the top 45 companies, Deutsche Börse can kick the company out immediately. The prerequisite is that there is a successor who comes in at least 35th place in both categories. Zalando, Delivery Hero and Symrise currently have opportunities. One can assume that. The fund companies DWS and Union Investment, which have now reduced their stake, have already announced that they are considering legal consequences. Numerous plaintiff attorneys and shareholder advocates representing smaller shareholders are likely to follow. The law firm Tilp has already filed a model lawsuit.\n",

            " An estimated 70 percent of the hearing aids sold in Germany today are unused in the drawer. For example, many people with limited hearing fail because of the cocktail party effect: in complex listening situations with many sources of noise and speakers, they are overwhelmed and cannot follow a conversation partner. Current hearing aids only support selective hearing to a limited extent. Directional microphones are already used today, but the hearing aids are not aimed precisely at a speaker. They lack the necessary feedback from the brain for this. Now researchers from the mEEGaHStim network (see box below) showed how they determine the speaker who the listener is following from the signals of an EEG (electroencephalogram). This works not only in the laboratory, but now also with mobile EEG sensors on the go. In addition, test series confirm that electrostimulation on the scalp increases listening comprehension in relation to a selected interlocutor. In addition to microphones and loudspeakers in the ear, the newly developed hearing aids therefore require a number of EEG sensors and additional electrodes for stimulating certain brain regions. The researchers are also working to further develop and miniaturize the technology. With an EEG, brain activity can be observed using voltage fluctuations on the surface of the head. At the University of Oldenburg, scientists developed a mobile EEG system: the so-called cEEGrid. Ten electrodes each on a flexible carrier in the form of the letter C stick to the left and right behind the ears. A hearing aid equipped with this device measures the brain waves on the move, without the user having to put on a large, annoying EEG standard hood in everyday life. In the laboratory, researchers at Fraunhofer IDMT demonstrated with mobile EEG sensors that there is a correlation between a speaker's speech signal and the listener's brain activity. Specifically, the scientists determined the so-called envelope of the tracked speech signal - a function that connects the fluctuations in the volume levels. In fact, this envelope can be found in the EEG signal. In their experimental studies, the researchers first simulated two different speakers using two loudspeakers distributed around the room. Instead of two hearing aids, they use a demo system consisting of two directional microphones, a mini PC and output channels. The PC determined the respective envelopes of the two speech signals. In the EEG of a test participant, the researchers clearly recognized one of these envelopes when the listener concentrated on one of the two speakers. The position of two speakers can be determined automatically with two microphones or hearing aids. HörTech in Oldenburg has developed a localizer that uses the arrival times of sound waves to calculate a probability map that marks each direction of a noise source as a peak. An additional tracker will later follow the once localized sources when they are hiking. The Master Hearing Aid (MHA) software evaluates the signals and calculates the directions. The hearing aid of the future integrates mobile EEG sensors on every ear clip. A tiara places electrodes for hearing-supporting electrical stimulation. Four omnidirectional microphones are used today in the mEEGaHStim project. A so-called HörTech beamformer calculates a directional characteristic in the form of a lobe from the microphone signals for the specified direction. According to the developer Dr. Align Kamil Adiloglu freely and thus reinforce the selected source. The main lobe of the beamformer is about 60 degrees wide, side lobes on the sides weaken their signals. In addition, the beamformer generates a binaural signal, so that the device wearer can hear spatially. The researchers are developing a gesture control with which speakers can be brought into focus. In the laboratory test, the beamformer aligns with the required speaker within 30 seconds after the required EEG analysis. The researchers are working on reducing this latency to such an extent that the system is almost real-time capable. On the other hand, tests with test persons are supposed to show whether such a time period is disruptive in everyday life or even more pleasant than a faster jumping system. The researchers are also working on how to distinguish speakers from other sources of noise. A gyroscope could detect head movements and track the beamformer for a short time. The demo system runs on an Intel NUC and can be transported in a briefcase with a power bank, an audio interface and hearing aid dummies with two microphones each. There are also ports for the Raspberry Pi and the Beaglebone Black. An embedded solution on a hearing aid chip called SmartHeap is to follow at the end of March 2021. To be miniaturized: At the moment, the hearing aid technology from the laboratory also includes a mini PC, an external sound card, two hearing aid dummies, each with two microphones, and a power bank - in a briefcase. The hearing aid of the future automatically focuses on a speaker and additionally sharpens hearing comprehension with the aid of electrostimulation. It is known that the so-called transcranial stimulation in the area of ​​the auditory cortex temporarily improves attention and the recognition of sounds. In Oldenburg, the team led by Professor Herrmann coupled the electrostimulation with the envelope of a speech signal and was able to improve listening comprehension. The sound signal and the envelope of a spoken sentence: Researchers were able to find this envelope in the listener's EEG as long as the listener followed the speech signal closely. Laboratory tests showed that test subjects understood spoken sentences with a worsening signal-to-noise ratio significantly better if envelope stimulation stimulated their cortex for this speaker. According to Herrmann, hearing impaired people benefit particularly greatly from the stimulation. In contrast, the effect is minor in people with healthy hearing. \"In our tests, we found that the envelope curve in the EEG appears with a short time delay to the acoustic signal,\" says Herrmann. The stimulation should therefore take place with a latency of approximately 100 milliseconds, with the optimal time period having to be determined individually for each user. The mobile EEG enables automatic speaker recognition and use of directional microphones. The stimulator from manufacturer neuroConn is currently the size of a cigarette box. At around one microampere and 20 volts, lithium-ion batteries are sufficient for one to two weeks of operation. The developers around project coordinator Klaus Schellhorn want to downsize the system so that it fits in one ear in the future. Issue 13/2020 Read: Test offer from c't Further links: What's next with OLED technology? This is how teamwork succeeds from a distance. The University of Siegen makes concrete design suggestions and ideas for the handling of future hearing aids. A team led by Professor Marc Hassenzahl carried out design studies: Should it be better to hide the hearing aids under the hairstyle or emphasize them as a high-tech device? Apparently, the notion of striking fashion accessories has prevailed in Siegen. The design consists of three parts with two ear clips and a tiara. This design takes into account all the specified points for the electrodes of the EEG, which today cover the cEEGrid stickers, as well as the electrodes for transcranial electrical stimulation on the top of the head. So that the wearer does not have to shave the scalp, the use of electrolytes is provided. They are in small pump balls on the diadem. If the electrodes lose contact, the user presses on the balls and moistens them. The research association mEEGaHStim develops next-generation hearing aids. These are intended to evaluate and stimulate brain waves so that the wearer can better follow a conversation partner in a confusing situation. Institutes and companies are involved: Researchers from the Fraunhofer Institute for Digital Media Technologies IDMT and the University of Oldenburg use brain waves to read which speech signal a person is concentrating on. HörTech gGmbH develops algorithms that use this data to determine the direction of the speaker, follow the localized sources and align microphones. Professor Christoph Herrmann from the University of Oldenburg, together with neuroConn GmbH, is developing additional electrical stimulation that helps hearing impaired people to understand better. Based on the results, Professor Marc Hassenzahl from the University of Siegen is building the first prototypes of hearing aids with suitable scalp electrodes. A similar discussion about \"open or hidden\" led the Siegener to control the hearing aid of the future. A Bluetooth remote control or a smartphone app could certainly be used for this. But how about hand gestures in free space? Studies with test subjects have shown an interesting aspect. These people were involved in a conversation with an actor with a striking hearing aid system. This caused short disturbances due to noise from the neighboring room. The actor looked around and then had to return the focus of his hearing aid. He either did it hidden behind his hand or quite openly with striking gestures. The feedback from the impartial test subjects showed that secret manipulations appear neurotic and arouse mistrust. Open gestures were more inviting and better suited to an open hearing system. The technology for aligning the microphones using EEG evaluations could be miniaturized so far in the coming year that manufacturers can equip their hearing aids with them. However, it takes even longer until hearing aids electrically stimulate the auditory cortex. At neuroConn, Schellhorn is expecting around five years before the cigarette-box-sized electrostimulator is compressed enough to fit in a hearing aid. Concrete talks with manufacturers are already underway. Open source project Master Hearing Aid.\n",

According to the information, the actual happening was already some weeks ago. The young woman is said to have ordered a total of 50 pizzas from a delivery service from Steyr between February 20 and March 12 - to wrong addresses, so that the pizzas could never be delivered correctly. The heart of these fake orders was lovesick, the police say they now have learned from a woman's confession. During the delivery, she always observed her ex-boyfriend, who worked as a deliverer, it is said. No further details on the case were initially disclosed.\n",

            " More than 500 bidders were registered for the three-day auction that took place on the Internet due to the corona pandemic. A set of twelve plates that César Ritz ordered for the opening of the hotel in 1898 changed hands for 6,800 euros. Champagne buckets were also well received: bids rose to 11,700 euros, 58 times the estimated value. One of the highlights of the auction was glasses from the Hemingway bar, which is named after the US writer Ernest Hemingway, who stayed at the Ritz. Six martini glasses with the engraving \"Bar Hemingway Ritz Paris\" were sold for 2100 euros, six vodka glasses from Ercuis for 1800 euros each. Artcurial auctioned furniture from the Ritz back in April 2018. At that time, 10,000 objects went to new owners for a total of 7.2 million euros. Interior view of the Hotel Ritz, around 1920 In Parisian Ritz, numerous greats of the time stayed in the 20th century: in addition to the fashion designer Coco Chanel, the writers Marcel Proust and Francis Scott Fitzgerald as well as the silent film star Rudolph Valentino. Lady Diana Spencer spent the last hours of her life here before she died in a car accident in August 1997. The Egyptian billionaire Mohamed al-Fayed bought the house in 1979 and renovated it extensively. His son Dodi was dating Diana. The Nazis occupied the Ritz during World War II. According to legend, as a soldier, Hemingway entered the posh hotel on August 25, 1944 with his weapon in order to \"personally liberate\" it. Several films were also made at the Ritz, including \"Ariane\" by Billy Wilder from 1957, with Gary Cooper, Audrey Hepburn and Maurice Chevalier.\n",

            " Until a while ago, Stefan Homburg was mainly known because years ago he co-wrote one of the standard works in economics, advised several governments and was a kind of star in German economic circles. For decades he has (with) set the tone. Now there are rows of headlines about how the professor appeared on the Ken Jebsen podium in the corona crisis and suspected that, given the restrictions on contacts, we were basically in 1933, when the dictatorship was going straight ahead. For which there is a lot of approval from those who find that Mrs. Merkel is only deceiving and manipulating us. What Homburg has been trying to instill for the people as the only truth every day for weeks with all kinds of numerical data, despite obvious corona false forecasts. A professor who has become the chouchou of angry citizens and conspiracy neurotics? And complained about the lack of freedom of expression, in order to then declare your own interpretation as the only possible one? May occur. What Homburg has been demonstrating for weeks could only be a symptom: for how much the star ranks of German economic and political consultancy have been shaped by people over decades, who politically treated the public with a strong conservative tendency and zeal for thinking - and who continued to do so afterwards not so far on the right. That would not be a problem either. Except when what such formative starlets instilled in politicians for a long time may have been - and still is - based more on the conservative world view than on scientifically reliable empirical evidence. A German problem. Then what is currently emerging in this country as a departure from the orthodox market liberal rule would be the late correction of a political list. How strong the conservative impact was can be guessed at by looking at what has become of some of the top influencers of the 1990s and early 1990s, when liberal liberal dogmas had their wedding and it was (only) economic reason to lower wages To cut social spending and to relieve the rich (top performers). At that time, an omnipresent was a Hans-Olaf Henkel, who was the head of the Federal Association of Industry for streamlining the welfare state through Sabine Christiansen's programs - and later sat in the EU Parliament for an alternative period for the Alternative for Germany (AfD). Oswald Metzger was with the Greens - today he is a columnist for the right-wing conservative blog \"Tichys insight\" and for the right-wing populist \"Axis of Good\". Just like Stefan Homburg, who in turn has always been reporting nationally charged scolding about southern Europeans and the euro. A topic in which many a German influence economist is already switching to the subject of resentment, which is sometimes popular with conservatives; then you can say a thousand times that the Italian has no external deficits - he has, otherwise he would not be a slinging Italian. Born in 1965, has been managing the Internet portal WirtschaftsWunder since 2007. From 2002 to 2012 he was chief economist at the \"Financial Times Deutschland\". He is a co-founder of the \"Forum New Economy\", in which experts have come together to develop a new economic leitmotif. A touch of real satire resonates with Roland Tichy, who was able to set the tone for decades as the editor-in-chief (or vice) of mainstream newspapers such as \"Wirtschaftswoche\", \"Impulse\" and \"Capital\" during the weddings of the ordoliberal, and could eagerly declare all those outlaws who dared to doubt the holy grail. To complain today as the hostel father for frustrated conservatives that there is a mainstream and alleged opinion terror. Similar to the way Gabor Steingart likes to complain, who for a long time set the ordoliberal tone at SPIEGEL - and today likes to \"cuddle with the right\", as blogger Thomas Knüwer writes. Almost every day, the well-known economist Ulrich van Suntum complains about links-green, who likes to tweet \"Merkel weg\", praises the AfD and, like Homburg, is haunted by the fact that we are \"like in Hitler's time\". Another industry star, Harald Uhlig, is currently suspended because his university in Chicago is investigating allegations of racism. All of this is not clear? Here we go. In mid-2005, more than 250 economics professors signed the \"Hamburg Appeal\", a bizarre climax of ideologically charged orthodox economics in Germany - and proof of the dominance of the conservative worldview at the time. One of the three initiators: a certain Bernd Lucke. The man who co-founded the AfD in 2013. Once again (so that it doesn't say again that something is forbidden here): All is okay as long as it does not violate the constitution. And it doesn't mean that conservatives per se tend to be right-wing populism - of course not. It doesn't even mean that economists are always conservative on average; according to a survey from 2015, the forest-and-meadow economist would even choose red-green. The tendency towards conservatives seems to be more of an elite thing - and proof that those concerned have apparently managed to encroach and isolate themselves in the top economists category on the right for a long time. To which a lot of conservative Kronberger circles and Ludwig Erhard foundations and Bundesbank receipts may have contributed. Blistering before the Internet even existed. The problem is in the relevant list; and in the fact that overly obvious political and ideological tendencies collide with scientific objectivity at some point. Perhaps the long-standing legal burden can also explain why non-economists have the impression that economics is always somehow about people having to give up - and progress can only come about through suffering. Jesus! For which nothing really speaks. Of course, it fits the said worldview to always be more for cutting government spending; for longer work and against social hammocks and too high taxes for the rich. It is no coincidence that after three decades of more liberal dogmas, the gap between rich and poor is much larger than before. And one in four in Germany works in cheap jobs, while the supposed service providers have generally increased their salary significantly. And it is much easier for every entrepreneur today to use the staff as needed - no matter what the family says. However, this does not necessarily have to be automatically correct and economically efficient, as is now becoming clear. Contrary to what many economists have warned, the introduction of the minimum wage has not led to disaster on the labor market. Conversely, the dream of state economy has fatally contributed to the fact that too little has been invested in schools, universities, roads, rails and the like. Cutting social security benefits may please conservative hammock neurotics, but studies have shown that there is anger and tailwind for populists. And in the pandemic it suddenly seems absurd how poorly existential nursing staff and cashiers have been paid so far - because that's what the market wanted. It has long been shown that neither classics such as worshiping market forces, nor rustic appeals to personal responsibility help when climate crises, pandemics or populism need to be averted. If that's true, it is high time to correct the list. Then it is good if there is already more consensus in Germany that there will be no economic dynamism through renunciation and dismantling alone; or that it should be a question of not, but how the state is investing in the future as efficiently as possible; or that climate rescue simply needs government programs; and there is no longer any serious argument about whether there should be an economic stimulus package in a dramatic pandemic crisis, but how it looks best. In any case, the old political tendency is no longer so present among younger economists who were often trained internationally. Which in turn could explain why some of the old fighters and Homburgs and Tichys are so angry today that it is no longer what it used to be - where the mainstream economic policy was. This has nothing to do with singing out economic reason. Rather, returning to something that is politically less one-sided; and when it comes to sober knowledge, more counts than one or the other attitude note. After decades of dilapidated experiments. A catastrophe for conservatives? Nonsense. Even for a party like the CDU, it is not set in stone to only pay homage to the market and to demand less state per se. Even under Ludwig Erhard, that was not the case when there was much more regulation and higher top tax rates - long before the global re-entry of dreamy dreams, in the days of Reagan and Thatcher, when the disaster began. When the CDU was founded almost exactly 75 years ago, the guiding principles even said something about \"true Christian socialism\" that should be sought. It doesn't have to be that bad.\n",

Despite several requests, he does not put the knife down, but points to the bystanders and jumps on the spot. The policewoman pointed her service weapon at him, her colleague apparently sprayed him with pepper spray. Then the man with the knife in his hand runs towards the police officer who says \"The knife away!\" calls and then apparently fires two shots. The police disagreed with the first reports that the operation had involved evacuation. Prosecutor Frank Passade said on Friday afternoon that the man's apartment had been terminated without notice because he had suffered damage to property several times in the past. Representatives of the housing association were on site to inspect the apartment on Thursday. They were accompanied by the police. A mental disorder in the man was not excluded. When the police tried to put the 54-year-old on guard for a social psychiatric examination, the situation had escalated because the person concerned had not wanted it. It was announced on Friday morning that there was a police operation near Meppen in Emsland on Thursday with fatal consequences. A man from Guinea who was also armed with a knife was killed.\n",

A total of 500 young French bulldogs were found when checking the aircraft of Ukraine International Airlines at Toronto Airport, the authorities said on Saturday. The surviving animals had suffered from dehydration and weakness, among other things. The dramatic find occurred on June 13 at Toronto Pearson Airport. The Canadian Food Control Authority, which is also responsible for animal welfare controls, said that the next steps will be decided after the investigation is complete. A dog dealer who picked up another animal in the same hold where the bulldog puppies were found spoke on the CBC transmitter of a \"horror scene\". He felt like he was in a \"nightmare\", he said. Ukraine International Airlines was horrified by Facebook about the \"tragic loss of animal life\". Cooperate with the Canadian authorities to find out what happened and to prevent such an incident from happening again. French bulldogs are very popular with dog owners in Canada. Expert Scott Weese told CBC that a sale price of $ 3,000 to $ 4,000 could be expected per animal. Many Canadians mistakenly assumed that the dogs were bred in their own country, Weese said.

            " The UK government's drastic measures to mitigate the economic impact of the corona pandemic have caused the country's public debt to soar above its economic output. By the end of May, according to the ONS statistics office on Friday, debt rose by £ 173.2 billion or 20.5 percent year-on-year to £ 1.95 trillion. This is the strongest percentage increase over a year ago since monthly records began in 1993. As a result, total public debt rose above 100 percent of total economic output (GDP) for the first time since 1963. It was reported to be 100.9 percent of GDP at the end of May. The high debt ratio is also the result of the severe economic downturn. This reduces the GDP to which the debt is compared when the debt ratio is calculated. Government borrowing was £ 55.2 billion in May. That was about nine times as much as the borrowing in the same month last year. This is also a record.\n",

            " Corona numbers in Germany have risen again since last week. \"In our opinion, this is due to local outbreaks, such as in the meat processing industry,\" said the President of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), Lothar Wieler, at a press briefing by the institute. \"These outbreaks also affect the number of reproductions, which is currently estimated at 2.76.\" Over the past few weeks, an average of 390 cases have been reported to the RKI. Major outbreaks in Göttingen, Berlin-Neukölln and at the Tönnies slaughterhouse were known last week. As a result, mass tests were carried out - there have been more than 1,300 positive corona tests at Tönnies alone. As a result, the number of new infections per day increased. \"In our opinion, the increased R value is due to these outbreaks,\" said Wieler. \"But there could also be other reasons.\" Overall, one could say that the corona measures in Germany worked and worked well, said Wieler. The population went along very well. \"But we still have to be careful, the virus is still in our country and if we give it a chance to spread, it will take it - we can see that from the current outbreak,\" said Wieler. \"The pandemic is not over yet, it is not over worldwide, and it is not over in Germany.\" The current outbreaks could easily be spread to the population through contacts. Therefore, it is still important that everyone adheres to the measures, said Wieler. A new component of the measure is the Corona warning app, which has been downloaded by around 12 million people so far. You can help to break such chains of infection earlier. \"I can hardly imagine that we will have no more cases in the next few months,\" said Wieler. \"We will have the virus in our country continuously.\" However, the company wants to continue trying to keep the number of cases so low that it is possible to contain and end outbreaks locally. \"Everyone has to do this: stay at home when you are ill, get tested, comply with hygiene rules, be vigilant and reactive - that will be the new reality over the next few weeks and months.\" The virus would not leave Germany, and even if there were no new cases in Germany, they would be imported again from abroad.

            " According to estimates by the RKI, there is currently a second wave in Iran: \"Everything points to this,\" said Wieler. In South Korea, there has been an increase in the number of cases so far, but it is not yet possible to assess whether it is a second wave. \"At the moment it looks more like a peak than a second wave.\" Israel is also seeing an increase in cases, particularly in the context of schools. \"Again, I don't know if you can already speak of a second wave.\" In principle, a second wave must be assumed everywhere, including in Germany. \"But I am optimistic that we can prevent the second wave.\" By now you would know how to contain the virus without a vaccine.\n",

            " Shortly before the start of its first WWDC virtual developer conference, Apple released new iOS 13 distribution figures. According to this, the current generation of the operating system runs on a total of 81 percent of all iPhones that are still in use. The number of devices that have been introduced in the past four years is 92 percent. For this reason, the federal government's Corona Warning app works on most iPhones. Because the app requires the installation of iOS 13.5 on Apple's mobile phones, a free update that is available for all iPhones that run iOS 13. The widespread use of the current iPhone operating system should also be one of the reasons for the high number of downloads, at least to date. Government spokesman Steffen Seibert said on Monday that the app had been downloaded 11.7 million times, almost a week after its release. \"It runs on more than 85 percent of the smartphones available in Germany,\" said Seibert. \"Of course one would wish that (...) everyone could work with any old smartphone, but there are technical reasons that cannot be wiped out by the political will of the federal government.\" However, the developers had agreed to check again whether an increase is possible. Seibert did not explain in detail what the technical reasons are, which limit the availability of the app to certain smartphones. Even Google and Apple have not yet explained why the jointly developed technology on which the German app is based requires at least Android 6 or iOS 13.5. So far, one can only assume that it is due to the way the two companies developed the way in which Bluetooth short-range radio is used for communication between the cell phones without putting too much strain on the battery. The restriction to have at least Android 6 or iOS 13.5 installed means that only iPhones that have been on the market since 2015, i.e. everything from the iPhone 6S and the first iPhone SE, and Android smartphones from the year of manufacture 2014 and 2015, are compatible with the Corona warning app. In addition to the technical compatibility, other factors restrict the user group. The app can currently only be loaded from the German app stores of Apple and Google. Foreign students, employees or travelers are therefore not able to download the app from their home country stores onto their cell phones. Why this is so remains unclear. The decision whether an app is only available locally or internationally is made by the respective provider, in this case by the Robert Koch Institute. On request, the institute informed SPIEGEL that \"it is currently still being checked whether the app can also be made available in the app or play stores, particularly in neighboring countries\". Technically, it would be no problem to switch the app to worldwide availability. The change in the stores would only take a few minutes. At least as long as the app remains unchanged. Another problem is that many people living in Germany do not speak German as their mother tongue. One is working on accommodating these groups of people, however, said SAP Technical Director Jürgen Müller of the \"Bild am Sonntag\". Accordingly, variants in Turkish, Russian, Arabic and Romanian are planned. It should start with the Turkish version, which according to Müller should be ready in four weeks. Why it takes so long to translate the app's contents into Turkish, he didn't say.\n",

            " It must have been kindergarten when I pointed a finger at a couple of Turkish-born girls while doing gymnastics. \"Mom, why are they so golden?\" I asked, looking at her shimmering skin tone. Another child's mother sat next to us on the bench and laughed: \"You're golden yourself!\" When we discuss racism in Germany, about minorities, I remember that story that my mother often reminded me of years later. I wonder how much I have in common with the Turkish girls from the workers' district in which we were doing gymnastics at the time. Or with all the other children in Germany whose parents immigrated and who looked a little different than my friends Katrin and Nicole. The Greek seamstress, to whom I bring something once a year, likes to say: You could also be Greek. She wants to compliment me. Recently in the market, the seller at the olive stall behind her face mask asked, \"Where are you from?\" And we chatted for a while about her Iranian and Indian names. Something similar happened at Ikea: In front of the cash register, an older woman with a headscarf spoke to me quietly: \"Are you Turkish?\" She was looking for someone who would exchange her Ikea voucher for cash, and apparently hoped for a compatriot who would be more willing to do so.

With a published statement, the late-night presenter responded to criticism of his appearances from the nineties, in which he had, among other things, painted himself black for a parody as basketball player Karl Malone. \"I hesitated a long time to speak because I knew that this would be celebrated as a victory, equate the excuses with weakness and cheer the leaders who use prejudice to divide us. This delay was a mistake,\" wrote Kimmel in his explanation. \"There is nothing more important to me than your respect, and I apologize to those who have been really hurt or offended by my makeup or words.\" He started with the Malone parody on the radio in the mid-1990s. When he later brought her on television, he wanted to see Malone as much as possible, said Kimmel. \"I never thought that this could be seen as anything other than an imitation of a fellow human being. One that has as little to do with Karl's skin color as with his plump muscles and bald head.\" At this point you will find external content from Twitter that complements the article.

            " According to its government, Australia has become the target of a massive cyberattack by another country. Behind the attack is a \"state actor\" with cutting-edge technology, said Prime Minister Scott Morrison in Canberra on Friday. He left open which state it could be. The \"malicious\" cyber attack is directed against \"all levels of the government\" as well as against important infrastructure, the head of government said. Political organizations, the industrial sector, and education and health care are also affected. However, the attackers have remained unsuccessful in many cases, Morrison said. No personal data were stolen. The Australian security agency worked closely with allies to address the problem, especially with the partners of the Five Eyes intelligence alliance, Morrison said. In addition to Australia, this includes the USA, Great Britain, Canada and New Zealand. Morrison said he had spoken to his British counterpart Boris Johnson on Thursday evening, among other things, about the cyber attacks. China is likely to be the main suspect among the countries that could be behind the cyber attack. Tensions between Canberra and Beijing had recently intensified. China, for example, imposed punitive tariffs on a number of Australian products in May. In the past, Australia, as well as other western countries, have accused China of being behind large-scale cyberattacks. Morrison did not name a country, but said, \"There aren't too many government actors who have these skills.\" Relations between the two countries are also impacted by the corona pandemic. The Australian government sparked anger in Beijing by accusing China of covering up the origins of the pandemic and calling for an independent international investigation. The Chinese government then advised against traveling to Australia. However, the Australian borders are largely closed to foreigners anyway due to the corona virus.\n",

            " Several employees of a slaughterhouse of the PHW group in Wildeshausen in Lower Saxony have tested positive for the corona virus. The company announced this Tuesday. According to this, 23 out of 50 employees tested positive in a series of tests. PHW is best known for the \"Wiesenhof\" and \"Bruzzzler\" brands. The group claims to be the largest German poultry farmer. The affected company, Geestland Turkey Specialties, has around 1100 employees. They should now all be tested for a corona infection. PHW holds a majority stake in the slaughterhouse. District Administrator Carsten Harings (impartial) said that measures should now be taken together with the company to curb the spread of the virus and to work out the causes. More than 1100 employees had already been tested in early June, and an infection case was discovered. According to the district, 22 of the 23 currently infected had previously been tested negative. A new employee was not yet part of the tests in early June. Tönnies, Germany's largest slaughterhouse, had recently become a corona hotspot. More than 1500 employees of the Tönnies meat factory in NRW are infected with Covid-19. Now the cinemas and gyms close again in the district, meetings are prohibited, strict contact restrictions apply.\n",

            " The headmaster's job is becoming increasingly unattractive. Michael Gomolzig from the Baden-Württemberg Education Association has been observing this for years. The administrative effort is increasing, he reported to SPIEGEL in autumn. \"There used to be four to five well-qualified applicants for an advertised school management position. Today you can be happy if you even get an application,\" said Gomolzig. In a representative survey of school heads, scientists have now investigated why people still accept the job - and whether they want to stick to their decision. The researchers from the universities of Tübingen, Lüneburg and the University of Teacher Education at the University of Applied Sciences Northwestern Switzerland have repeatedly interviewed 405 school administrators at general education schools. According to the report, around a thousand school administrations are currently missing across Germany. At first glance, the results look good. According to this, a large majority of the school heads surveyed are satisfied with their professional careers (96 percent) and enjoy their work (95 percent). However, more than half (53 percent) of school leaders report chronic stress due to work overload or even excessive demands. A quarter of them suffer from a lack of recognition and experience the effort as stressful. Almost 16 percent say they have burnout symptoms. According to the report, the burden at comprehensive, secondary and secondary schools is significantly higher than at high schools. Task and motivation are also sometimes in conflict. \"Our survey shows that the reasons for the choice of profession and the work reality of school administrations differ widely,\" says Colin Cramer, who is responsible for the study at the University of Tübingen. The majority of respondents report that they primarily want to develop and test new ideas (93 percent), have a varied and creative task (86 percent), care for other people (85 percent) and make their own decisions wanting to meet (85 percent) motivated her to take up the post. When asked about their activities, however, 67 percent of school administrators state that they mostly ensure that day-to-day business runs smoothly. Tasks aimed at fundamental renewals, on the other hand, only play a major role in 16 percent of those surveyed. According to the survey, a fifth of the school management thinks about leaving the current school and wanting to change jobs. The reason for this is that more than half of the school management states the desire for professional development (52 percent), but often also an inadequate payment (44 percent) or a perceived lack of support (31 percent). The gross annual salary of school heads is between 30,000 and up to over 100,000 euros, half earn less than 66,000 euros. The average income varies greatly depending on the type of school: for example, a school head at primary school earns 60,000 euros on average, while the head of secondary school receives 72,000 euros. Women are underrepresented in management positions compared to their share of the teaching staff. Although almost only teachers teach at primary schools, only 72 percent of primary school administrators are female. They also form the majority in secondary schools, but only occupy 37 percent of management positions. Overall, their share is 54 percent, the researchers write, on average the school management is 54 years old.\n",

            " When Dennis Wagner arrived in Detroit for an internship, the student from Bergisches Land only wanted to stay for a few months. Wagner has now been living in the United States for almost 20 years. In Atlanta, Georgia, he set up a subsidiary of the steel supplier BESTAR in Remscheid. Wagner has 15 employees, he pays taxes in America, his daughter just graduated from high school in the South, and now the whole family has American citizenship. According to Donald Trump, such immigration success stories could hardly exist in the near future. This week, the US President imposed new visa restrictions that affect students, au pairs, seasonal workers, but also highly-skilled workers and managers. Trump's reasoning: In the economic crisis triggered by Corona, foreigners posed an \"extraordinary threat to the employment of American workers\". The US would create an \"America First boom\", a senior official told journalists. For BESTAR shareholder Wagner, this means that in the future he will no longer be able to fly in a technician from Germany if one of his customers has problems processing special steel for sawing and industrial knives. The consequences are even more dramatic for other companies. Car companies like VW or BMW need constant know-how transfer, if only because America has no apprenticeships like mechatronics engineers. The college graduates look at the craft from the imported instructors. Trump's L-1 visa is now blocked, as is the work permit for foreign directors of international corporations. Seasonal workers, such as Trump himself employed as cleaning staff and waiters in his golf clubs and hotels, are also banned, with a few exceptions. But the ex-real estate mogul currently has other priorities: elections will be held in November. \"Trump must make his base happy,\" Wagner is clear. After all, during his reign, the president had otherwise delivered little: \"It's about symbolism.\" Like Wagner, most observers doubt that companies will now employ Americans en masse instead of foreigners. Sophie Alcorn is a lawyer specializing in immigration law in Silicon Valley, helping companies bring foreign-based professionals to the United States. Many of their customers are tech companies and IT start-ups, and they always have the same problem. \"My customers tell me: 'Sophie, we would be happy if we could save you and the costs, but we cannot find anyone here for the job'.\" Around three quarters of the so-called H-1B visas for specialists traditionally go to the tech industry. The companies often have to spend thousands of dollars on the complex application process to bring experts for future fields such as artificial intelligence to the country. And almost one in two of the Fortune 500 companies was founded by an immigrant or an immigrant's child, according to a 2017 study. Trump's latest foreclosure maneuver caused widespread anger in the tech industry: Apple CEO Tim Cook said \"deeply disappointed\". America was an immigration nation based on diversity and the \"constant hope of the American dream,\" Cook said: \"Without both, there will be no new prosperity.\" Amazon, which received more H-1-B visas in 2019 than any other company, warned of a loss of the competitiveness of its economic power. Even Tesla boss Elon Musk, who is considered to be the president, criticized the visa ban. It is \"now is not the time to cut our country off from the world's talent or to create uncertainty and fear,\" warned Microsoft President Brad Smith. Her phone is no longer at a standstill, says lawyer Alcorn. Whether companies, migrant workers or family members hoping for reunification - \"everyone is afraid\". Alcorn believes that many could now give up the fight for a work permit: \"I fear that the regulation will achieve its goal of scaring people and scapegoating immigrants.\" Cornel Fuerer is one of those who are watching Trump's anti-immigration course with growing discomfort. The Swiss lawyer is one of the kind of highly qualified immigrants that governments around the world are fighting for. He studied in Geneva and New York and has worked in Hong Kong and Düsseldorf, among others. In 2007, his employer DuPont sent him to St. Louis, Missouri. In the meantime, Fuerer and his family have the coveted green card, which gives them permanent right to stay in the USA. At least on paper. The vice president of the seed and agricultural chemicals company Corteva Agriscience no longer feels certain: \"These are very scary times for anyone who is not a US citizen.\" Fuerer observes how the Trump administration is gradually tightening its course against immigrants. He is certain that he has not taken the job from an American. Finally, his employer had to convince the US authorities that the foreigner had irreplaceable qualifications. Fuerer does not want to leave his adopted home USA. Trump does not stand for the majority of society, he believes: \"Only a small marginal part of the population is xenophobic.\" Attorney Alcorn is also convinced that America is still \"the beacon of hope\" for many people around the world. But if she now calls friends from Germany, there is little to be felt of longing for the New World: \"They tell me: 'America is on fire, why should I move there?'\" The lawyer still has an answer: \"I'm trying to explain that our President's actions do not reflect our society and our economy. \"\n",

            " The list of allegations against gangster rapper Gzuz is long: violations of the weapons law, drug possession, assault. Now the member of the hip hop group 187 street gang has to answer for the district court of Hamburg - again. In mid-February, Gzuz, who is actually called Kristoffer Jonas Klauß, did not appear at the start of the process and had to pay a deposit of 100,000 euros for not being excused. This time the rapper appeared on time - to take a few selfies in front of the courtroom, as the NDR reports. Before the trial could begin, the rapper's lawyer filed a motion for bias against judge Johann Krieten. He also said that he had reported Krieten for the right to be deprived of liberty. He was referring to the warrant that the judge applied for Gzuz after he missed his trial in February. During a house search in April 2018, 17 grams of marijuana, two and a half grams of crystal meth and Böller were found in Gzuz's Hamburg apartment. On New Year's Eve 2018, he is also said to have fired a start pistol several times, although he has been prohibited from carrying weapons of all kinds since August 2018. In his apartment in Halstenbek in the Pinneberg district, officers found a start pistol and ammunition. In February this year, the gangsta rapper is said to have tried to steal an oxygen bottle from an unlocked ambulance. And in March, Gzuz is said to have slapped the face of a woman who wanted to take a selfie with him on the Reeperbahn. His lawyer said: \"He felt pressured and just wanted to push the cell phone aside.\" Gzuz has already made several appearances under criminal law, including for bodily harm, property damage and insult. The rapper is known for filming encounters with the police and distributing them through his social media channels. He had already been arrested in 2017, but was then released under conditions.\n",

            " Reinhard Härle is upset. The man, born in 1953, is the mayor of Dellmensingen, a district of Erbach in Baden-Württemberg, in which, on the late evening of May 24, 2019, five young men from right-wing extremists were said to have thrown a torch towards a caravan belonging to a Roma family. Since May 2020, they have had to answer to the Ulm district court. This Monday the local mayor is heard as a witness. Härle brought a lawyer with her. It seems that he does not really answer the questions of the court. He is concerned with something else that day. It is about the reputation of Dellmensingen, a place with 2700 inhabitants. The man, on whose property the Roma family was camping at the time, had told the police that the local mayor had called him because several citizens had complained about the family's presence. \"Can you tell us something about this?\" Asks the presiding judge. The witness speaks fast and broad Swabian. The calls were not received by him, but by his wife. There were no complaints, just asking if the family could stand there with their caravans. The callers would have asked, \"Did you approve that?\" No big deal - that's how he puts it. When his wife told him about the calls, he got on his bike and went to the meadow with the caravans. The meadow is a private property. He called the owner. He told him that the family had his permission. That was all right for him, the mayor. The judge follows. Who exactly called his wife? Härle starts again, repeating what he has already said. There were no complaints, just asking. Then he changes the subject. He is annoyed by the report about a defendant's statement that Dellmensingen is \"quite right-wing\". He is also annoyed that a police officer said that he did not believe him, the local mayor, that he no longer knew who called from the village about the Roma family. \"The news that a village is on the right and a local leader is unreliable hit me hard.\" \"You didn't answer my question,\" the judge interrupts. \"Did your wife tell you who called?\" \"She probably told me the names,\" he says. He doesn't want to give names in the hall. At the time, according to the police, he initially denied that there were any calls. \"That's not true,\" says Härle. But there were no complaints. \"People wanted to know if that was agreed.\" Not more. He portrays everything as a major misunderstanding. Telling the police that it was not him but his wife who answered the calls was not considered important at the time. The prosecutor asks for reactions in the village after the flare. The witness says that at the time they discussed in the local council to take a public position. They didn't. \"We didn't want to interfere with an ongoing case.\" But when it was said that \"a village is on the right\", they gave a press conference. \"Everyone is very welcome in Dellmensingen,\" says the mayor, \"no matter what skin color.\" Mehmet Daimagüler, the lawyer for the Roma family, asks if there is a right-wing scene in the village. \"I don't know that,\" says Härle. The witness is released. Daimagüler makes a statement. He expresses doubts about the depiction of the local mayor: \"For the witness, the reputation of the location is more important than the conditions in the location.\" A defender takes the floor. The credibility of the information provided by the local mayor is irrelevant to the defendants' questions of fact and guilt. \"Whether Dellmensingen is a right-wing or patriotic village can be left open for our case.\" The next witness, 23, was a friend of three of the accused. He had told the police that he thought they were \"very right-wing\". The judge asks what he is clinging to. \"Certain statements,\" is the answer. The judge asks several times. Finally, the witness mentions \"pictures with Hitler on it\" that were sent via WhatsApp. From whom? He no longer knows. At one point it was enough for the adjudicating judge: \"I have the feeling that you are walling. Answer the questions! Don't mess around here!\" But it remains tedious. Back then you heard \"German rock\", says the witness. The band Landser, for example. Daimagüler wants to know what the songs are about. \"It goes back to old times,\" says the witness, \"wartime.\" Daimagüler reads the first lines of a Landser song, the court grants him: \"I am Berliner, what could be nicer? / A proud German, not a Turkish pig.\" \"I don't know the song at all,\" says the witness. \"Did you notice that Landser was banned as a criminal organization?\" Asks the lawyer. No, he doesn't know about that. A defense lawyer asks the witness about his Turkish father. Whether there were problems in the Freundeskreis. No, no problems. Then Daimagüler makes another statement. \"Bands like Landser are not just any bands. Such music is played by hardcore Nazis.\" And to the defense lawyer: \"There are also Turkish Nazis. Having a Turkish father does not mean that you cannot be someone who does not want to remember the right place and who hears Landser.\"\n",

            " After 15 years, Apple gives Intel the pass. Instead of using the chips from the world market leader, the iPhone group plans to equip its Mac computers with its own processors in the future. For both companies, this step means a drastic change. Intel loses a major customer that is very important for prestige, Apple gains even more autonomy and becomes even more independent of supplies from others. Rumors that this step was imminent had been around for a long time. In other years, there would have been thunderous applause for this announcement at the McEnery Convention Center, but not in Corona year 2020. This time, the WWDC developer conference will take place on the web in San Jose, California. Microsoft showed in May with its build conference how to do this. Similar to that, there is a pragmatic advantage of moving to the web: Instead of a few thousand developers, almost any number can take part in the event because there are no spatial limits. How many followed the kick-off keynote on Monday on the web, on YouTube and in Apple's developer app is still unclear. The number should go into the millions. And watching the cleverly choreographed video show was worth it. Apple CEO Tim Cook spoke of a historic moment in the company's history. Cook could be right with the pathetic-sounding statement. Because the in-house chips that future Macs are supposed to work with are based on the same technology as those that work today in iPhones and iPads. Software chief Craig Federghi showed a Mac computer with the same chip as the current iPad Pro, an Apple A12Z Bionic. Compared to Intel's chips, the company's own models have the advantage, among other things, that they are much more energy efficient, said Apple's chief of chip development, Johny Srouji, in a video recording. The fact that Srouji had a gig at all is extremely unusual. The chip developer is usually kept by Apple like a company secret, just like the technologies that he develops with his team. Cook opened the chip developer's video clip with the words that Srouji would now be switched on from a \"secret location\". One can assume that it is in Israel. In the coastal city of Herzliya, Apple operates its world's second largest development center, Srouji, which previously worked for Intel and IBM, comes from Haifa, 80 kilometers away. Apple has already demonstrated the advantages of combining your own software with your own chips with phones and iPads. In performance tests, Apple's smartphone processors always perform significantly better than the competition's models. The company is now hoping for similar advantages in its Mac computers. By adding functions tailored to the chips for Apple's software and by adapting the software directly to the chips, more power can be drawn from the system. To do this, however, some adjustments are necessary. Apple's own programs are already adapted to the new technology. Apple plans to make it easy for other software developers to make the switch with new programmer software that creates Mac programs to run on both old Intel Macs and Macs with Apple chips. According to Craig Federighi, for example, Microsoft is already working on an office version for the new chips. Adobe is also adapting image processing programs such as Photoshop and Lightroom to the new hardware. To make it easier for users to transition to the new hardware over a two-year period, Apple is integrating software called Rosetta 2 into a new version of its macOS operating system. This makes it possible to run software written for Intel chips on new Macs with Apple chips. Apple used a similar technology in 2005, when the company switched from IBM's PowerPC chips to Intel chips. The killer feature of the future Macs should be that they will also run iOS and iPadOS apps. After all, the new Mac chips are based on the same technology as those in iPhones and iPads. This possibility could give Apple a host of new Mac customers. For example, if iPhone users prefer a Mac to a Windows PC, because they also run the iPhone apps that they have become accustomed to. Apple plans to introduce a first Mac with its own chip at the end of the year. The company left open what kind of computer it will be, whether MacBook or iMac. Developers can apply to get a Mac mini with an Apple chip for a fee of $ 500. When more Macs will come with \"Apple inside\" is completely unclear.\n",

            " The payment service provider Wirecard announces that it has applied to the Munich District Court to open insolvency proceedings. Here you can read more about it. In the meantime, the Munich public prosecutor has arrested the former Wirecard boss Braun. A judge should now decide on pre-trial detention on suspicion of market manipulation and falsification of the balance sheet. The Dax group Wirecard is sinking in an unprecedented balance sheet scandal. 1.9 billion euros that were held in trust accounts of Asian bankers may not even exist. The EY auditors refuse to approve the Wirecard annual financial statements - and the company itself is at risk of serious financial difficulties. The scandal has been looming for years - and this is how long many of the actors involved have been grappling with the case. The most important people and institutions at a glance: Markus Braun and the Board of Management Retired Wirecard boss Braun: Dominator for years. Markus Braun's resignation is a turning point for the group - rarely is a company connected to a person like Wirecard to the 51- year old Austrian. Braun joined Wirecard in 2002. He made the company big and is its largest shareholder with more than seven percent. As a result, Braun lost hundreds of millions of euros on paper on Thursday and Friday. The teacher’s son studied business informatics at the Vienna University of Technology and received his doctorate in social and economic sciences. He likes to wear black turtlenecks and doesn't just give himself an intellectual touch. In the German financial world, actually a rather narrow cosmos in which everyone knows everyone, he is more of a loner and an outsider. His empire was Wirecard. In the four-member board, he was the absolute dominator. He was considered the technological and strategic brain of the company. This is why the Wirecard critics find it difficult to believe that he shouldn't have known about the irregularities. Over the years, Braun has never been able to dispel critics' doubts; he has always denied all allegations without explaining much. The closest confidant of Braun was Jan Marsalek, who was responsible for the operational business - until he was released on Thursday. He was replaced by James Freis, who previously worked at Deutsche Börse and is primarily responsible for compliance, i.e. compliance with rules and laws. After Braun's resignation, Freis moved to the top just a day later, initially as interim chief - a man who had only known the company for a few weeks. The board is complemented by Susanne Steidl (product, AI, development and operations) and Alexander von Knoop (finance, capital market communication). Your contracts expire at the end of the year. Thomas Eichelmann and the supervisory board supervisory board chairman Eichelmann: Does the cleaner keep up? The control committee has been headed by Thomas Eichelmann, who was CFO of Deutsche Börse from 2007 to 2009. In 2019, he initially became a simple member of the Supervisory Board, now replacing his predecessor Wulf Matthias, who has been chairman of the committee since 2008, but was never perceived as a serious counterweight to Braun. Eichelmann had announced an improvement in controls and the first changes in management after he took office, Braun's operational business was withdrawn, Freis was brought onto the board. Since the auditing company KPMG recently submitted a devastating special audit report, Eichelmann has been under enormous pressure, shareholders have repeatedly called for his resignation. Eichelmann was originally intended to dismiss Braun as CEO in one or two years and to build up a suitable successor by then. Braun should then have switched to the supervisory board - now it's hard to imagine. From Eichelmann's point of view, Braun could no longer be held, otherwise he would have made himself unbelievable as a cleaner. Financial supervision Bafin BaFin boss Felix Hufeld: Wirecard under the supervision's eye Over the past twelve years, financial supervision has faced the question of whether Wirecard's share price is manipulated. The pattern was usually this: critics accused the company of falsifying the balance sheet or other irregularities, at the same time there were striking price movements triggered by so-called short sellers. Some of the allegations came from the investor scene, in recent years mainly from the \"Financial Times\" (\"FT\"). The Bafin regularly examined the striking price fluctuations, but until recently these investigations were primarily aimed at the investors and editors of the \"FT\". Last year, Bafin therefore filed a complaint against \"FT\" editors and several investors. The Munich public prosecutor's office is investigating. In addition, last year the Bafin temporarily prevented so-called short sales with Wirecard shares, with which speculators bet on a decline in the price of the shares. Just last year, the Bafin also began to check whether Wirecard itself could have manipulated the rates through incorrect information and finally filed a complaint against the entire Wirecard board a few weeks ago, with the exception of new member Freis, who will now become the new CEO. The Bafin has often rejected the accusation that it is too lax against Wirecard with the argument that it only has direct supervision over the Wirecard Bank AG subsidiary. As for the mother Wirecard AG - against whom the allegations were primarily made - she was only responsible for possible violations of ad hoc obligations or the Securities Trading Act. Now, however, the bank subsidiary is also coming into focus. Among other things, it manages deposits from business customers. On the other hand, it grants loans, also to external partners of Wirecard, whose business is criticized for the lack of transparency of the cash flows. If deposit customers become nervous, it is extremely dangerous for a bank. Bafin is therefore now examining whether the 1.9 billion breakdown at Wirecard AG could in some way affect the banking subsidiary. According to SPIEGEL information, the Bafin leadership held intensive discussions with Wirecard and other participants on Thursday and Friday. The supervisory authority itself has not yet commented on the topic. The public prosecutor's office Courthouse in Munich: The public prosecutor's office is investigating The Munich public prosecutor's office is now investigating on several levels. On the one hand against \"FT\" journalists and investors who are said to have manipulated the Wirecard course through coordinated publications and trading activities. The information came from the Bafin, but was based, at least in the early stages of the investigation, on rather scanty findings. The accused reject the allegations. In May, the public prosecutor's office searched the Wirecard headquarters after the Bafin suspected market manipulation against the entire Wirecard board at the time. During the ongoing special audit of the balance sheets by the auditing company KPMG, the management had publicly announced that the audit relieved them of the fact that Wirecard would have a positive outcome. In fact, KPMG was very critical of the accounting. London hedge fund manager Christopher Hohn had also filed a complaint against the Wirecard board, also for market manipulation and fraud. The Wirecard accused also reject all allegations. In both cases, the investigation is likely to continue for a long time. The prosecutor said on Thursday that she was also taking the latest developments into account in her investigation. The \"Financial Times\" business newspaper \"Financial Times\": a stubborn opponent Under the leadership of journalist Dan McCrum, the London business newspaper \"Financial Times\" (\"FT\") has accused Wirecard in numerous articles in recent years. Mostly it was about possible forgery of balance sheets, circular transactions or money laundering. The \"FT\" relied on a broad information base, was apparently informed by company insiders - so-called whistleblowers - and put extensive figures and documents online so that everyone could understand their allegations. The accusation that the \"FT\" cooperated with short sellers who benefited from the negative reporting has always been rejected by the newspaper, which is highly regarded not only in the financial world. The short sellers Falling share prices: Short sellers rely on strong stock market movements So-called short sellers (English: shortsellers) bet on the share price loss of certain companies. They borrow shares, sell them at the current price, with the aim of being able to buy them back later at a lower price and return them to the lender. They take the difference as a win when the bet comes up. Such transactions are legal and, in principle, also make sense, because in this way price exaggerations can be corrected upwards. However, if the shortseller's calculations do not work out and the prices rise, they can lose more than their entire stake, so the risk is high. Most of these shortsellers are based in London, one of the most prominent is Christopher Hohn with his hedge fund TCI. He recently sold 1.5 percent of Wirecard shares short. Due to the price drop in the past few days, he should have earned a lot of money. He is not one of the short sellers against whom the public prosecutor is investigating for market manipulation. The Wirtschaftsprüfer EY building (in Berlin): Image damage threatens The audit firm EY (formerly Ernst & Young) has been checking the Wirecard balance sheets for many years. Up to and including the balance sheet for 2018, EY never had anything to complain about in the Group's figures, even in the years when massive allegations were already being made from outside. Last late autumn, Wirecard commissioned KPMG, the EY competitor, to carry out a special inspection due to the ongoing allegations of balance falsification. KPMG concluded this examination with a very critical report, among other things, the company found no evidence of payment flows in the amount of 1.9 billion euros. EY was also now unable to provide these documents or questioned the authenticity of the balance confirmations. If it turns out that Wirecard's balance sheet is incorrect, EY would have a major image problem, and the auditor might also be sued for damages. However, the auditors mainly examine the formal correctness of the figures, fraud can be difficult to detect in a normal audit. However, they would always have to investigate abnormalities and could then issue limited certificates. The banking district in Frankfurt: Some people are likely to get nervous here too. Wirecard reported on Thursday that loans of EUR 2 billion could be due if the missing EUR 1.9 billion did not reappear and there were therefore no audited financial statements . Wirecard's bank debt is spread across a larger number of credit institutions, at least 15 are believed to be in debt. If the banks actually pay debts, they could put Wirecard in solvency difficulties, but also increase the likelihood of defaulting even if they do trigger a chain reaction.\n",

            " Spoiler note: If you prefer not to learn anything about the characters in \"The Last of Us Part 2\" before playing yourself, you should read this article at a later time. The game will be released on Friday, June 19, for Playstation 4. After the joint is ignited and the THC begins to take effect, the mood is released. Ellie and Dina get closer on a rancid sofa in a basement full of cannabis plants. They talk about their first kiss a few days ago, kiss again. And then many more times. \"The Last of Us Part 2\" tells of hate and revenge (you can find our game test here), but also stories of queer desire. The players control Ellie, one of two protagonists, and experience the complicated and complex relationship with their companion Dina from their perspective. This is unusual for a video game. Queer stories and characters rarely have a place in blockbuster productions - \"The Last of Us Part 2\" changes this in more ways than one. \"The Last of Us Part 2\": Love and survival struggles Already in the first part, players could find out that Ellie was attracted to women. At that time, this story was outsourced to the additional story \"Left Behind\", which could be bought separately. According to a trailer for \"The Last of Us Part 2\", which was presented at the E3 games fair in 2018 and which showed in close-up how two women kiss, there was homophobic statements from gamers on the one hand and concern on the other queer players that it could be queer baiting - the practice of suggesting queer stories but not telling them. In \"The Last of Us Part 2\" the desire between Ellie and Dina is initially speechless. Both have to find the right words for their feelings, learn to read gestures and hints. Similar to the life of queer people, both of them need to find a language, a narrative for their relationship. This is a central part of the game. There are always quiet moments in it. On the shabby sofa, for example, in a synagogue or even in the supposed security of a self-made home, in which there is room for telling this desire. All players are confronted with it. The action cannot be hidden because it is an integral part of the action. What has long been common in many other media is now being tried for the first time in a blockbuster video game by the Naughty Dog development team: telling a queer story that is clearly readable as such and that is part of the game's DNA. \"The Last of Us Part II\": A queer story that is clearly readable as such Sony Interactive Entertainment It will not be a coincidence that this attempt to put a queer story at the center revolves around two attractive women. In the games industry it is practically tradition to target games primarily to a heterosexual male audience. Over the years, it has become a self-fulfilling prophecy that only men are interested in games. Traces of this thinking still exist today, and with them the belief that a queer man as a protagonist frightens off that audience, while a queer woman could be attractive. Stories about marginalized people have a hard time when game makers fear sales slumps and therefore don't give space to non-heterosexual or non-white characters - which in turn makes it difficult to build an audience that wants to experience these stories. Incidentally, the launch trailer of \"The Last of Us Part 2\" again focused entirely on violence, no trace of the desire of two women.

            " Anyone who plays the game will still be surprised: \"The Last of Us Part II\" tells more than just a queer story. In the course of the plot, the players also meet Lev, a trans boy. His story also becomes central, his concerns and concerns become those of the players. For example, if they set out to stop him from visiting his mother, who would probably mistreat him - because he is trans. And Lev doesn't want to be asked why he used to have a different name, the dead name. Lev doesn't want to be questioned, he just wants to exist. And this goal also becomes the goal of the players - some of whom have presumably never dealt with trans people before. \"The Last of Us Part 2\" by Sony, for Playstation 4, approx. 60 euros; USK: From the age of 18 So the determining topic in \"The Last of Us Part 2\" is certainly violence. It lies over every desire, every love, every budding hope. That is the framework in which everything is told. Nevertheless, queer desire is not relativized, not hidden. And for some players, the biggest shock of the game may be that it confronts them with stories that they otherwise avoid. No matter whether lesbian, pansexual or trans: the game lets players experience identities that are far from what is usually constructed in mainstream video games. The bright, white, heterosexual hero, he doesn't exist here. Another step for the industry would be that queer stories sometimes find a good ending in a blockbuster video game. That they cannot only be told in the context of a crumbling world with constantly lurking dangers. But in the way that these characters are happy.\n",

            " After the end of the corona restrictions in retail, the Germans' willingness to buy seems to be returning gradually. For July, the consumer climate barometer of the market research company GfK predicts an increase of nine points to minus 9.6 points. \"Consumers are increasingly waking up from the stiffness that had led to an unprecedented drop in sentiment in April,\" said GfK expert Rolf Bürkl. \"But we're not over the mountain yet\". The current value is still the third lowest value ever measured by the Nuremberg market researchers. The Germans, on the other hand, have returned to optimism about the economic outlook. The GfK indicator for economic expectations is currently 8.5 points, which is even higher than the long-term mean of zero. Pessimism about income is also waning. \"The weak light at the end of the tunnel, which was already evident last month, is apparently getting a little brighter,\" said Bürkl. Economic stimulus measures such as the announcement of a temporary reduction in VAT also contribute to this. If retailers and manufacturers should also pass these on to consumers, it can be assumed that one or the other planned acquisition will be brought forward to the second half of 2020 and thus serve as a pillar of the economy this year. According to Bürkl, however, it is questionable whether the economic climate will ever return to what it was before the crisis. \"It could turn out that buying behavior changes\", the question: \"Do I need all of this?\" will be asked more often than before. There is also the risk of a corona setback. Infection events such as in meat shops in North Rhine-Westphalia or at controversial major tennis events in the holiday destination Croatia could lead to uncertainty. On behalf of the EU Commission, GfK surveyed 2,000 people in Germany between June 3 and 15 for the study. The study relates to total private consumption. Germans spend around 30 percent of their consumer spending on retail, the rest is on rent, travel, leisure or services.\n",

            " The coronavirus outbreak at the Tönnies slaughterhouse fueled the debate over the massive inequality of treatment of foreign workers in the German meat industry. EU Labor and Social Commissioner Nicolas Schmit threatens Germany and other countries to enforce more justice by means of a directive. If necessary, proceedings for violation of the EU treaties are also conceivable. \"Seasonal workers must be treated on an equal footing with all other workers,\" Schmit told SPIEGEL. If they fell under the EU posting of workers directive, their situation would be clear: \"The same wages for the same work in the same place.\" Should this be violated, \"I do not rule out that we will also open infringement proceedings against the countries concerned,\" the Luxembourg Commissioner emphasized. According to Schmit, the problem is, however, that the workers concerned usually do not fall under the EU posting of workers directive because they are employed by a domestic (sub) company rather than a foreign one - \"a questionable procedure,\" Schmit says. The Commission would soon publish guidelines \"to clarify the situation for the member countries in this area\". If practice continues to circumvent EU social standards, \"then we will have to check whether we can take action against it if necessary,\" Schmit said. It would then have to be transposed into national law by the member countries. The German meat industry is heavily dependent on Eastern European workers. According to figures from the Federal Employment Agency, around 22,400 Romanians, 8,300 Poles, 3,300 Hungarians and 2,500 Bulgarians worked in slaughter and meat processing at the end of September 2019. On average, they earn several hundred euros less per month than the approximately 84,500 full-time employees in Germany, as the BA announced when asked by the left-wing parliamentary group in the Bundestag. First of all, it is the responsibility of the member countries to ensure the application of the rules and, in particular, to carry out corresponding controls, said Schmit. He therefore welcomed corresponding plans from the Federal Government. \"It is the right way to create order here.\" Schmit announced that the Council of EU member states would also deal with the issue. \"We cannot always talk about the social pillar of the EU and then allow tens of thousands of workers to fall through the net.\"\n",

            " The current economic downturn is the most violent in generations. There is now clarity about this. And the eurozone will be hit harder than other major economies. Current forecasts only predict a slow recovery (Wednesday there is news from the Ifo Institute on the mood in German companies); prosperity levels in western, but especially in poorer, countries could remain below the level of 2019 for years to come. That would be a social tragedy with considerable political setback potential. The crucial question is: How do we find out about this predicament? All eyes are on the states: governments and central banks are pumping trillions of euros and dollars into the economy. The social systems are running at full speed, stimulus programs are being adopted; States participate in corporations (pay attention to the Lufthansa general assembly on Thursday). The old breaks away - and offers space for the new The state can secure the income of private citizens for a while, boost demand, catch up with stumbling businesses and banks. However, he can neither decree nor subsidize sustainable prosperity growth. A substantial boost in innovation would be needed to increase the production potential of the economy. Right now you need real entrepreneurs - people who are willing and able to act and try out new things in this economically, politically and epidemiologically very confusing situation. People with a willingness to perform and to lead, who have the courage to risk things without knowing what will end up including the possibility of their own failure. Henrik Müller is a professor of political journalism at the Technical University of Dortmund. Previously, the doctor of economics worked as vice editor-in-chief of manager magazin. Müller is also the author of numerous books on economic and monetary issues. For SPIEGEL he gives a pointed outlook every week on the most important economic events of the week. Crises offer opportunities. The structural change is accelerating. New needs and requirements arise. Various companies were founded during the Great Depression of the 1930s, which later grew into large companies. In the depression year 1930, for example, the car brands Porsche and Pininfarina, the logistics company Dachser, the fountain pen manufacturer Lamy, the electrical company Grundig and the fast food chain Kentucky Fried Chicken were created. In 1938, after tough years of economic shrinkage in the United States, Bill Hewlett and David Packard started their later electronics giant. Who will follow them today? The vaccine developer Curevac from Tübingen, in which the German government is contributing 300 million euros and who nevertheless aims to go public in the United States? What justifies high profits - and what doesn't We are faced with a thick wall of smoke. We don't know if Covid-19 comes over us again in a global wave, when a vaccine or effective treatments are available, whether the geostrategic situation between the great powers USA, China, India, Russia and others is extremely acute (watch out Monday at the EU-China summit), whether Great Britain exits the EU internal market at the end of the year with or without an affiliation contract, whether the West breaks down in a trade war, whether a green age begins with electromobility and the hydrogen economy, or whether a renaissance of the climate-damaging fuels coal and oil is imminent - to name just a few acute examples of known moments of uncertainty. In such phases, many people, including managers, adopt behavior that is too human: duck away, cling to one another and remain paralyzed. Uncertainty unsettles consumers and investors. This is precisely why recessions can become chronic to depression. On the other hand, entrepreneurs, as it is seen in a branch of economic theory, are people who differ from other people primarily in that they find their way in an extremely confusing environment and remain capable of acting. It is they who take leadership in phases of uncertainty. Incidentally, it is this special ability that justifies high profits: entrepreneurial profits, once formulated by economist Frank Knight, resulted solely from the \"inherent, total uncertainty of things and the brutal fact that the consequences of human action are unpredictable\". In other words, those who can handle it have earned their money - because they provide decisive impulses for society and get them out of lethargy. Really uncertain The corona crisis is an uncertainty shock that humanity has not experienced for a long time and the effects of which can hardly be estimated. The financial crisis of 2008 was a financial market accident that occurs again and again. The euro crisis of the years from 2010 stemmed primarily from the lack of willingness to agree on the part of important EU governments, including the German, that is to say from political failure. Everything is different this time. Measuring \"real exogenous uncertainty\" is extremely difficult, if not impossible. The consequences are unpredictable. Such shocks can hardly be predicted. After all, better early detection strategies would be possible (as our Dortmund research center DoCMA explains in a recently published paper). Braking growth Persona Real insecurity requires real entrepreneurs. Unfortunately, this is not one of Germany's strengths. Ebbe is the rule for start-ups: the rate of start-ups has almost halved since 2000, according to the Economic Experts Council (\"Five Wise Men\"). In recent years, when the German economy was good, even more companies were closed than newly founded. The decisive factor that favors entrepreneurship in the crisis is the availability of qualified employees. In economically good times, the established large companies suck the labor market empty. They attract with good payment, secure jobs, and guaranteed working hours. This has been the case in the past few years. Accordingly, the uncovered need for labor increasingly became a brake on growth. With at times more than 1.4 million vacancies, corporations were barely able to meet their personnel requirements. There was an acute shortage of technologically demanding qualifications. It was even more difficult for ambitious startups to find people, as a survey by the accounting firm PwC shows. Even companies in the craft or agricultural sector gradually ran out of employees. All of that is currently changing. The number of vacancies fell suddenly with the onset of the corona crisis, as the Institute for Labor Market and Vocational Research (IAB) has determined. The number of short-time workers is many times higher than in the last crisis of 2008/09. Seemingly safe jobs are no longer as safe as they seemed to be recently. So far, the unemployment rate has only increased moderately. But if the crisis drags on, many industrial companies will continue to shrink their workforces - and continue on the course they took last year. The car companies and their suppliers are cutting staff, as are large banks, retailers, the hotel industry and airlines - the list could be extended. The fact that university graduates from technology-related courses were attracted directly from the university with very decent salaries, promised career advancement and a 35-hour week, these times are likely to come to an end. This opens up scope and opportunities - for the new, the unexpected and (in the good sense) surprising. Brussels / Beijing - Chinopa, impossible - EU-China summit by video.

            " Numerous people were killed in heavy storms in India, and numerous people are said to have died as a result of lightning strikes. The authorities assume at least 104 deaths. Several others were injured, for example because gusts of wind and heavy rain outlined trees and electricity pylons and destroyed simply built houses. This was announced by the civil protection authorities of the two affected states, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. According to the authorities, the victims are mainly farmers and homeless people who were outside at the time of the storm. The storm was part of the beginning monsoon in northern India. The monsoon season in South Asia usually lasts from June to September. Rain is vital for agriculture, but it also often causes great damage. This also includes lightning strikes - and dozens of people die again and again. However, as many people as now in the state of Bihar have not died on a single day for several years, said a civil protection worker there. Bihar is one of the poorest states in India.

            " The so-called ring light, a circular lamp with an open center, does not necessarily impress with its versatility. But it is an ideal light source for portraits and also conjures up the characteristic light ring around the pupils of a model - provided the ring light has a usable size of at least 18 inches (about 48 centimeters). To give the photo shown a special touch, a continuous light ring was combined with two system flashes. The experiment shows that continuous and flash light ideally complement each other in this combination and additional color filters allow many variations. Combined with different outfits and poses, there is no boredom. What is special about this structure is the mixture of continuous ring light (a) and system flashes (b, c). Position the main light (a) frontally from above, at an angle of approximately 20 degrees. The distance to the model should be chosen so that the light ring in the eyes reaches at least the diameter of the pupils. The orange gradient on the white background cardboard is created by color filters that are attached in front of the system flashes. The photos were taken with a full-frame camera at f / 2.8. The open aperture creates a pleasant focus in the image and at the same time a blurred background that softens waves in the paper. The illustration with highlighted tone value separation makes it clear that the ring light emphasizes the cheekbones (a). At the same time, the increased lamp position results in a drop in light towards the neck (b). The special feature of this light source is the characteristic light ring that is created in the model's eyes (c). The size of the light reflex can be adjusted by the distance between the lamp and the model. The distance also changes the drop in light on the face. The closer the light source is to the model, the greater the differences between the light and dark areas. DOCMA 94Doc Baumanns magazine for digital image processingJuly-September 2020 Docma shop Docma - subscription and free edition Docma - magazine for digital image processing The ring light is primarily suitable as a frontal main light source and is therefore ideal for close-ups. Nevertheless, you create variety by varying the background. In example (a) only the ring light is used, the model sits against a black background. This will make your face stand out. The second image (b) shows the setup presented in this article, but with two other color filters.

            " The district court of Munich II sentenced a police officer, who abused many boys, to a prison term of four years and four months. This was reported by several media, including the \"Süddeutsche Zeitung\". The accused was found guilty of, among other things, the sexual abuse of those under protection and the possession of child and youth pornographic images and films. The now suspended official from the Starnberg district was arrested in spring 2019. The 60-year-old sexually abused children and adolescents for years. According to the indictment, he used his work as a board member in a volunteer fire brigade for the actions. As a result, he mostly committed himself to boys, some of whom were under the age of 14 and were therefore legally still children. The court's verdict fell short of four years and ten months' imprisonment. The man's lawyers had pleaded for four years and three months' imprisonment. They pointed out that the defendant had shown remorse for his actions. On the first day of the trial, the parties to the trial had agreed on a sentence of between four years and three months and five years and three months based on a comprehensive confession by the accused.\n",

            " Fired Wirecard board member Jan Marsalek may be in the Philippines. There are indications that Marsalek could still be in the country, the Philippine Justice Minister Menardo Guevarra said on Wednesday. According to insiders, Marsalek is at risk of being arrested in the Munich investigation into the billion dollar scandal of the payment service provider. The Philippines has no extradition agreement with Germany. Guevarra said Marsalek was in the Philippines from March 3-5. \"There is some evidence that he recently returned and is still here.\" The Philippines does not know whether Wirecard is active in the country. But the authorities found something \"strange\" about Marsalek in the immigration database. \"Let's leave it at that,\" said the Minister of Justice only. The Philippines was investigating people involved in the Wirecard accounting scandal. This also includes Marsalek. He had instructed the authorities to coordinate their investigations. The Philippines play a central role in the accounting scandal. The missing billions are said to be in escrow accounts at two Philippine banks. However, the relevant documents turned out to be fake. Marsalek was the right hand of Wirecard boss Markus Braun for years and was also responsible for the Asian business. Ex-boss Markus Braun has been released on Tuesday afternoon. After a night in custody in Munich, he was released on bail of five million euros, said Braun's lawyer and a spokesman for the Munich District Court on Wednesday. Before he was arrested, he had sold most of his shares. Braun, against whom the public prosecutor's office is investigating suspected accounting fraud and market manipulation, has to report to the police every week. Meanwhile, the business situation for Wirecard is coming to a head: with Uber competitor Grab, a prominent customer turned away from Wirecard on Wednesday. The most valuable Asian start-up declared that its partnership with Wirecard would be put on hold until further notice. Observers fear that other customers will follow suit. With regard to the collaboration with Wirecard, Aldi Süd said: \"We are still reviewing the matter.\" Customers include the Dutch airline KLM, the Swedish furniture store Ikea and Fedex. The future of the group also depends on the willingness of customers to stay on track. Talks with creditor banks to save Wirecard are in full swing. The banks are trying to get an overview of Wirecard's situation. The service provider for cashless payments, which had grown rapidly in the almost two decades under the leadership of Markus Braun, had admitted earlier this week that in all likelihood, assets in the balance sheet of EUR 1.9 billion did not exist in Asia. The investigators accuse the 50-year-old Austrian of having inflated the balance sheet total and turnover alone or with other perpetrators through pretended income. The aim was to make the company more financially strong and more attractive for investors and customers. Financial supervision Bafin is now also assuming that the balance sheets for the years 2016 to 2018 are wrong. She had therefore expanded her criminal complaint on suspicion of market manipulation. In addition, according to insiders, a special representative at Wirecard Bank AG watches over the fact that the institute's funds are not used to fill the financial gaps at the parent company Wirecard. Since the beginning of the year, she has been campaigning for customer funds with competitive terms. The Bafin, which is under the supervision of the Treasury, sees itself exposed to massive criticism because it acted late against the company. The CDU finance politician Matthias Hauer also sees an obligation on the Federal Ministry of Finance to clarify the accounting scandal. \"I expect that the scandal will be resolved consistently and completely, both under criminal and regulatory law,\" said Hauer, the rapporteur for the CDU / CSU parliamentary group responsible for the case in the Bundestag's Finance Committee. The roles of the supervisory authority Bafin and the Ministry of Finance should be questioned. \"The goal must be to close gaps and weaknesses in the supervisory regime. I therefore welcome the fact that Finance Minister Scholz has now admitted mistakes in the Bafin that he oversees.\"\n",

            " There are adventures that are better avoided. A tour of Germany with an electric car is one of them. Those who rely on public charging stations can quickly get lost in the confusion of apps and payment systems - and experience a nasty surprise at the latest when charging electricity. Finding a pillar is difficult. When refueling, the chaos really starts. Every common standard is missing. According to surveys, the average driver uses up to six different charging apps, five charging cards and other electronic means of payment such as PayPal and credit cards. The cheapest price can hardly be found. Customers often only see what the trip cost on the bill weeks later. The reason for the misery is the dominance of regional electricity providers. Years ago they divided the charging station market among themselves in order to increase their profits. Up to now, apart from a few thousand e-car drivers, this has not bothered anyone. Since e-mobility has become a question of fate for German car manufacturers, it has dawned on the supervisory authority that this charging station Babylon is an obstacle. It wants to open up the regional monopolies. Special reports, analyzes and backgrounds on topics that affect our society - from reporters from all over the world.

            " Singer Max Giesinger became a star with hits like \"80 million\" or \"Legends\" - before his music career, however, he felt like a loser. In any case, the 31-year-old now told the newspapers of the Funke media group about himself: \"I was shy and quiet, sometimes even a downright closed to lonely boy.\" \"In the beginning I perceived myself as a loser,\" said Giesinger, \"and then of course the other kids also missed this stamp.\" Even today, he is a melancholic person, which he benefits from writing songs. According to Giesinger, he first tried it beyond music, in 2011 he began training as a bank clerk. \"It was a total bankruptcy. After only two weeks I threw it all down, it was all so terribly barren,\" he said. \"At that time I finally realized: I have to make music and nothing else.\" Max Giesinger comes from Waldbronn near Karlsruhe. After years as a street musician and in bands, he made it to the finale of the casting show \"The Voice of Germany\" in 2012. After differences with his record company, Giesinger released his debut album \"Learning to Walk\" on his own and with donations from the fans. His first big hit was \"80 million\" in 2016.

            " Jersey has so far played no role in the debate about measures to counter German tax evasion. However, recent tax office statistics show that the Channel Island at least deserves more attention. According to a report by the \"Süddeutsche Zeitung\", the Germans parked a total of 180.8 billion euros there in 2018. This emerges from a response from the Federal Ministry of Finance to a request from the left faction. With Switzerland and Liechtenstein, the ranking of tax havens included countries that play a central role in the public's perception. In fact, the assets of German investors in Jersey are larger than there. According to the Ministry of Finance, 133.1 billion euros were reported from Swiss accounts to Germans in 2018, and 125.8 billion euros from Luxembourg. In total, Germans had at least 591.3 billion euros in accounts at the tax havens listed by the Federal Ministry of Finance in 2018. The basis of the data is the so-called automatic exchange of information. States inform each other about accounts that foreign taxpayers maintain with them. This is said to make tax evasion more difficult. Ministry of Finance statistics say nothing about whether the money is legal or illegal. The responsible tax authorities will check this after the data has been transmitted. According to \"SZ\", however, some of the tax havens that are probably significant are missing from the ministry's list. The Caymans and the Bahamas, for example, require statistics about their countries to remain secret.\n",

            " Some families move closer together in crises. With the Tönnies butcher dynasty, the opposite is evident. The long smoldering family dispute escalated after the Corona outbreak in Rheda-Wiedenbrück. Before an extraordinary general meeting in the afternoon, Robert Tönnies sharply attacked his uncle Clemens Tönnies in a letter - and again asked him to resign. The letter begins without a polite formula with a simple \"Clemens\" and with words, how shaken he was by the events in Germany's largest slaughterhouse. Robert Tönnies accuses his uncle of hiding behind his press spokesman, who seems helpless with the situation - and initially communicated false information about a sensitive video from the Tönnies canteen. On Friday, the spokesman said that the recording of alleged violations of corona prevention rules is older than initially reported. Regardless of this video, which is now dated to the end of March, occupational health and safety identified deficiencies at Tönnies between 11 and 18 May. The distances between the users of a canteen were too small, a spokesman for the district government Detmold told the news agency dpa. At a follow-up inspection on May 29, the deficiencies in the hygiene requirements had been remedied. The number of seats was also reduced as required. Robert Tönnies, who already called for his uncle's resignation in another letter dated June 17, also demands his co-determination rights in the current letter, also in order to overcome the blockade of the group in work contracts - and demands the removal of numerous shareholders. He concludes with words in which he apparently brings Tönnies' son into play: \"Clemens, I would advise you to clear your place for Max. We can only go into the future credibly with new faces.\" Because of the Corona outbreak at Tönnies, five criminal complaints have been received by the public prosecutor's office in Bielefeld. Among them is an advertisement by the Bielefeld Bundestag member Britta Haßelmann (Greens), said Chief Prosecutor Martin Temmen. It is now being investigated against unknown people because of the initial suspicion of negligent bodily harm and violation of the Infection Protection Act. Meanwhile, 25 Bundeswehr soldiers have arrived on the premises themselves to carry out corona tests. The spokesman for the Bundeswehr in North Rhine-Westphalia, Uwe Kort, said: \"Barriers and fences were set up.\" The district of Gütersloh had previously asked the Bundeswehr for help with a series test for corona infections at the slaughterhouse. A total of 25 soldiers from Augustdorf in the neighboring district of Lippe and from Rhineland-Palatinate are now deployed in Rheda-Wiedenbrück. 13 of them are on site as medical soldiers, twelve for documentation. Bundeswehr soldiers at Tönnies in Rheda-Wiedenbrück In total, the authorities test around 5000 Tönnies employees for the virus. In addition, 7,000 people are already in quarantine due to the outbreak in the Rheda-Wiedenbrück facility. By Friday afternoon, 3500 tests had been carried out at Tönnies. 803 results were positive and 463 negative, the rest were pending. The outbreak has serious consequences for the entire region: schools and daycare centers in the district are dense again, and the population is growing angry. District administrator Sven-Georg Adenauer described the monitoring of the ordered quarantine as a huge problem. Health authorities and regulatory authorities could only check on a random basis whether those affected abided by the conditions, the CDU politician told Deutschlandfunk. The police are also involved and are now driving more patrols. The city of Osnabrück in Lower Saxony increased its precautionary measures because of the outbreak. She ordered a two-week domestic quarantine for all Tönnies employees who live in their area. The district of Gütersloh lies on the state border with Lower Saxony, Osnabrück is around 60 kilometers from Rheda-Wiedenbrück. The market leader in the meat market is also facing increasing economic difficulties. The food discounters Aldi Süd and Nord announced that they were in contact with Tönnies and other suppliers due to the Corona outbreak. \"It is particularly relevant for us to find out whether all protective measures have been implemented and followed,\" said a spokeswoman. Aldi added social aspects to its animal welfare checks. \"This enables us to monitor compliance with social standards and due diligence in the slaughterhouses.\" The Federal Ministry of Labor is currently working flat out on the proposed draft law for the planned tightening of occupational safety and health and for the extensive ban on work contracts in the meat industry. Union agricultural policy makers have called for more regional slaughterhouses. North Rhine-Westphalian Minister of Agriculture Ursula Heinen-Essen meanwhile wants to prevent meat dumping offers with a Federal Council initiative. \"There are hair-raising special promotions where meat is sold well below its value. We have to stop that,\" said the CDU politician of the \"Rheinische Post\". The aim is to make the exceptions provided for in the law against unfair competition significantly more difficult. State Labor Minister Karl-Josef Laumann (CDU) announced that the infection process in slaughterhouses would be scientifically examined. After the slaughter at Tönnies has stopped, processing is now gradually phasing out. The last animals had been slaughtered on Wednesday on the instructions of the Gütersloh district. On Friday, the remaining stocks in the areas of beef and sow cutting and onion fat were processed and these areas shut down, as spokesman André Vielstädte announced. More production lines would now follow.\n",

            " The parcel, which is considered one of the crime scenes in the case of abuse by Münster, should no longer be given to tenants. A meadow orchard is planned at the location, said chairman Thomas Lampe of the allotment garden association \"Bergbusch\". The \"Westfälische Nachrichten\" had previously reported about it. According to the investigation, the main suspect Adrian V. in the arbor that belonged to his mother, along with other men, had abused several children, including his partner's ten-year-old son. The police have video footage of the abuse in the arbor. The garden house was first searched and sealed two weeks ago and removed a few days ago using the THW. Investigators wanted to make sure that they didn't overlook evidence in hidden places in the arbor. The police have since released the area, according to a spokesman. The house, including the floor slab, had been completely removed. According to Lampe, the allotment garden association now wants to set up the plot \"as part of a joint effort\". \"We are planning to create a orchard and a wildflower meadow there,\" he said. A bee hotel should also be built on the new common area.\n",

            " Compensation for the decommissioning of hard coal and brown coal power plants could rise significantly. This is shown by internal documents that are available to SPIEGEL. The cabinet is currently discussing the changes, and the coal exit law is to be passed in the Bundestag next week. In a correction of the legal text by the Federal Ministry of Economics, the maximum premiums for decommissioning hard coal were raised. For example, instead of 65,000 euros per decommissioned megawatt of hard coal electricity, there will now be 98,000 euros in 2025. For the year 2026, the sum will be increased by as much as 40,000 euros. Extrapolated to the coal-fired power plants is about millions more euros that the state should pay to the operators. And there are even more concessions to hard coal operators: For example, the time for tenders for power plant decommissioning is to be extended by one year until 2027 - that would be around one gigawatt more that would have to be compensated with millions of euros. As a result, \"no legal reduction will be required between 2028 and 2030,\" the paper said. The forced shutdowns would then only take place from 2031. Another change that the Ministry of Economic Affairs has corrected into the law should also cause unrest: While the entire exit law is passed by the Bundestag, the government now wants to outsource paragraph 49. This regulates the details for the lignite exit. However, this has been reversed in other versions. The cabinet is currently still negotiating this. To this end, the government has negotiated with the operators of the lignite corporations in recent weeks. The resulting \"public law contracts\" no longer have to be submitted separately to the Bundestag for approval. The Parliament \"gets to know them\". If, for example, the MPs do not agree with the increased severance payments in the contracts, they must now vote against the entire law and thus against the coal phase-out. This should not be easy for the Greens in particular, who have been pushing for months now that the coal phase-out is finally making progress. The contracts also include the billion dollar compensation already known. For the decommissioning of all power plants by 2038 at the latest, a total of 4.35 billion euros are to flow to the two companies RWE and Leag. RWE is scheduled to take the first power plant off the grid this year. Critics had previously criticized that the sums were no longer appropriate given the massive decline in the value of lignite. However, the contracts are relatively clear with Leag and RWE's \"mining law responsibility\": It stipulates \"securing compensation payments for the costs of restoring the mines\", the contracts say. Accordingly, the operator cannot simply say goodbye after bankruptcy or the closure of the power plants. Leag and RWE must therefore also use the funds to make the landscapes devastated by the lignite excavators usable again. Oliver Krischer, deputy parliamentary group leader of the Greens in the Bundestag The opposition in the Bundestag is disappointed after reading the draft for the first time. The proposed amendments would not have improved the coal phaseout law - on the contrary. \"With the far too large compensation amounts, I expect more serious climate protection,\" said Oliver Krischer, deputy group leader of the Greens. \"The lignite-fired power plants in particular are shut down much too late and frequently.\" That means significantly higher CO2 emissions and, under certain circumstances, energy-related problems if many power plants are disconnected from the grid at once. \"You can't really explain to taxpayers why the old and depreciated coal-fired power plants are still receiving compensation,\" complains Krischer. \"The contracts are better than their reputation,\" comments Kai Niebert, head of the German Nature Protection Ring and one of the biggest critics in the former coal commission. \"With the far too high and especially unjustifiable compensation for the Leag, the brown coal is buried generously, but at least not artificially kept alive.\" According to the current market situation, the lignite phase-out could even happen \"on its own\" because the form of energy is simply no longer competitive. Legally, an earlier exit from the present law is even possible. \"As the climate crisis progresses, the phaseout of coal will come faster than the coal commission suspected. This will be expensive to buy with the law, but the negotiated contracts make this possible.\" Coal experts such as Felix Matthes from the Öko-Institut and also a former member of the Coal Commission see other pitfalls in the law: Even more lignite operators from central Germany could receive compensation through the back door, although no compensation should be granted for decommissioning after 2030. \"Politicians could have to pay additional money to the operators of the Mitteldeutsche Braunkohlegesellschaft using an appointment trick,\" says Matthes. \"In general, the payments for lignite in East Germany are overestimated - so it is very questionable whether this is compatible with EU state aid law.\" A particularly great scandal is that the lignite company Leag may even get the first money from the law this year, although the first power plant will not be shut down until 2025. \"The federal states justify this with the recultivation of the open-cast mining landscape, but it is basically a liquidity injection as a gift to the operator, who has not done anything to date and exploits his opencast mines as much as permitted before the exit.\" A concession to climate activists is the promised conservation of the Hambacher forest. The contract between the federal government and the lignite companies states: \"Compliance with the decommissioning path can ensure that the Hambacher Forest (...) remains in its current appearance (...).\" RWE Power does not want to use the Hambacher Forest for \"open-cast mining\" contrary to the previous corporate planning, it says in the paper. The Hambacher Forest had developed into a symbol of resistance against climate-damaging electricity generation from coal in recent years. The Green Party and the Left Party do not really believe in the concession: there is still no legal guarantee that the forest will not be excavated. \"By sparing the Hambach forest, the Federal Government is granting the climate movement a symbolic victory, but it is still far from finding a policy that actually protects the climate,\" says Left Party chairman Bernd Riexinger.

            " When does summer start in Germany? At least not when the 25-degree mark is broken for the first time in May. In Germany, a distinction is made between the meteorological and calendar start of summer. What happens during solstice? Why does the meteorological summer start three weeks before the calendar one? And what distinguishes Germany from countries on the equator? The most important facts about the solstice: What is the meteorological beginning of summer? For meteorologists, summer in Germany begins on June 1st, officially it ends on August 31st. There is a very simple and practical background to why the four seasons in Germany last exactly three months: monthly averages and temperature statistics are easier for meteorologists to determine. It is therefore an artificial classification that is based as much as possible on the calendar data. What is the calendar start of summer? The time has come in Germany on June 20, 2020: At exactly 11.43 p.m. (CEST) - and thus about three weeks after the meteorological one - the calendar summer begins in Germany. It is the time of the so-called summer solstice. At this moment the sun is above the northern tropic and thus reaches its highest midday position. At no other time is a larger part of the northern hemisphere illuminated by the sun. While the days at the equator, the point that divides the earth into a northern and southern hemisphere, are almost the same or short all year round, the days around the solstice are longer than at any other time. In Berlin the sun can be seen a total of 16:50 hours. The shortest day - during the so-called winter solstice on December 21 - lasts less than eight hours (7:39). These characteristics are most extreme in the polar regions. While the sun never sets there in summer, it never rises in winter.\n",

            " The suspicion that Sars-CoV-2 has been circulating in Europe since the end of last year is borne out: the pathogen was detected in wastewater samples from the two northern Italian cities of Milan and Turin, which date back to December, according to a statement from Italy's national Health institute ISS. This is confirmed by a study that had examined wastewater samples in the past few months. The first officially confirmed cases of coronavirus were announced in Italy in mid-February. Due to the high number of deaths and the force with which the pandemic struck the country, it was assumed early on that the virus had spread unnoticed in Italy long before the first cases became known. Already at the beginning of the pandemic, Sars-CoV-2 genetic material was detected in stool samples from sick people. The researchers now analyzed around 40 samples taken from sewage treatment plants across Italy between October 2019 and February 2020. They found Sars-CoV-2 for the first time in samples from Milan and Turin from December 18, 2019. In Bologna, the virus was detected in waste water from January 29, 2020. \"These findings can help to understand when the virus started circulating in Italy,\" the ISS statement said. At the same time, this does not mean that the virus sequences discovered must necessarily come from those who would have introduced the virus into the country - an earlier spread is therefore conceivable. However, water samples could be helpful to control the spread of the virus. The ISS pointed to wastewater studies in France and Spain that had come to similar results. Not only the wastewater investigations from Italy indicate that Sars-CoV-2 spread much earlier worldwide than initially thought. In a French hospital, for example, the blood sample from a patient with pneumonia from December was subsequently tested positive for the coronavirus. In Barcelona, ​​researchers also found the virus RNA in wastewater samples from mid-January - around a month before the first cases were officially confirmed. A British study that examined mutations in the virus also came to the conclusion that Sars-CoV-2 had spread rapidly worldwide long before the first cases became known. The ISS announced a pilot project to test wastewater in tourist locations in July. A nationwide monitoring network should also provide information about the spread of the virus. Waste water is a \"strategic\" tool for an early warning system, since the virus could possibly be detected there earlier than in humans. The government in Rome declared provinces in Lombardy and Veneto a restricted area at the end of February. In the meantime, there has been criticism that the entire region should have been sealed off earlier. Italy was the first in Europe to be hit hard by the pandemic. The Chinese metropolis of Wuhan is the starting point for the corona pandemic. There, the novel corona virus was first detected in humans in December.\n",

            " When the general and dictator Gaius Julius Caesar was stabbed for life during a Senate session on March 15, 44 BC in the year 44, an almost two-decade power struggle broke out in Rome, as a result of which the Roman Republic collapsed. Written evidence from that time shows that the power struggle was accompanied by a period of unusually cold weather, with crop failures, famines, epidemics and corresponding unrest in the Mediterranean. Scientists have now identified the probable cause of this, they report in the journal \"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences\". They had found traces of a violent eruption of the Okmok volcano in the year after Caesar's death in Arctic ice cores. Gases and air particles are trapped in the eternal ice, preserving the climate history of the past 130,000 years. Although the volcano is in Alaska, thousands of kilometers from Rome, the eruption cooled the climate noticeably. Harvesting and famine followed, which further destabilized the political situation. The ashes in the ice cores from Greenland and Russia indicate that the volcano had simmered dangerously during Caesar's lifetime, in 45 BC. The big outbreak did not follow until a year after Caesar's death. The outbreak was one of the largest in the past 2500 years. The research showed \"how closely the world was connected 2000 years ago,\" said study director Joseph McConnell from the Desert Research Institute (DRI) in the US state of Nevada. Greenland ice core: gases are stored in the eternal ice that reveal the climate history It is well known that violent volcanic explosions can lead to abrupt climate changes: the particles emitted into the atmosphere can lower global temperatures for years and lead to more rain. In fact, according to the study, the two years after the second Okmok outbreak were among the coldest in the northern hemisphere in the past 2500 years; the following decade was still the fourth coldest. Climate models indicate that the average temperature in summer and autumn after the eruption was up to 7 degrees Celsius below normal. At the same time, it rained more than twice as much in summer in southern Europe. The rainfall in autumn was up to four times as high. \"The climatic effects were a major shock to an already stressed society at a crucial point in history,\" said Yale University historian Joe Manning, who also worked on the study. The results confirm written sources about famines from the time. Even the Nile flood so important for agriculture in Egypt is said to have been particularly low at the time of the volcanic eruption. The volcanic activities also provide an explanation for the ancient traditions of unusual atmospheric phenomena around Caesar's murder, which were interpreted as omens: records tell of rings around the sun, their darkening or light phenomena like sub-suns. However, according to the scientists, many of these phenomena were observed before Caesar's death and were probably more related to the eruption of Mount Etna in 44 BC.\n",

The start-up grew rapidly; it expanded to four continents, in more than 40 countries. Only in the corona crisis did success become a real boom. More and more restaurateurs sought help from Östberg; in times of lockdowns and exit restrictions, delivery apps were often the only way for restaurants to make any sales at all.

            " In the middle of the crisis in the department store chain Galeria Karstadt Kaufhof, a change of management is imminent. CFO and Labor Director Miguel Müllenbach (44) is to replace Stephan Fanderl as Chairman of the Board. On Tuesday, the Galeria board of directors meets to decide on the personnel, manager magazin learned from corporate circles. In the meantime, there was also speculation that Müllenbach could become spokesman for the management in a management committee. A company spokesman did not want to comment on this. Müllenbach started his career in the department store at Karstadt in April 2005. The business graduate has been a member of the management there since 2012. In his function as CFO of Galeria Karstadt Kaufhof, he is also responsible for IT and supply chain, the areas that most recently caused major problems for the department store. Even before his appointment, the personnel met with great criticism in employee circles. When Galeria boss Stephan Fanderl did not return to the company at the beginning of the year due to problems with the intervertebral disc, Müllenbach took over his job on an interim basis. Fanderl's resignation is also on the agenda at the Supervisory Board meeting. His contract was only renewed in November last year. Officially at Galeria Karstadt Kaufhof it was said that they would separate. In fact, there were different opinions between Fanderl and the owner, the Austrian Signa Group, about corporate management and culture. Signa had taken over Karstadt in the summer of 2014 and since then has been working towards a merger with Kaufhof. In the past year, the time had come. After several attempts and intermediate steps, Signa owner René Benko Kaufhof then completely absorbed himself. The joint operation started in January.\n",

            " It has been more than two years since Facebook announced that it would provide the research world with a wealth of data. As part of the Social Science One initiative, researchers from around the world should be allowed to use the network's internal data to investigate to what extent false reports shared over the network can influence the outcome of elections. Mark Zuckerberg even mentioned the initiative in his hearing at the US Congress as an example of the company's transparency. After the 2016 US election, it should help prevent interference in future elections. A few months before the 2020 US election, the initial enthusiasm in the scientific world gave way to sharp criticism. Researchers who should receive data from the study now describe the project as a failure. To date, less detailed data has been shared with the scientists involved than was originally the case. Facebook cited data protection concerns as one of the reasons. A previously unpublished study by the University of Amsterdam, available to SPIEGEL, now shows that rules such as the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) need not be an obstacle to scientific research. The researchers are also proposing binding rules that would oblige tech companies like Facebook, Google or Twitter to transparently share certain data with scientists or the general public. The study was written by Jef Ausloos, Paddy Leerssen and Pim ten Thije from the University of Amsterdam. It will be published jointly on Thursday with the German non-governmental organization AlgorithmWatch, which also commissioned the study. The authors of the study refer to two existing regulations as possible role models: firstly, the Finnish Findata system, in which health statistics are prepared and made available to researchers, among other things, and secondly, the pollutant register of the European Union. This obliges large industrial companies to publish the emissions and wastes that arise from their own operations in a way that everyone can see. From the successful implementation of the two existing systems, one can learn how the rules for mandatory data release could be structured, the study authors argue. It was important that it was clearly defined what type of data had to be shared with researchers and the public and that there had to be quality requirements for the meaningfulness of the data. In addition, an independent institution had to be created that securely processed the data from the tech companies and only then passed them on to researchers or made them publicly available. Such an establishment would also ensure that there are no concerns about the General Data Protection Regulation as it could ensure that personal data is only anonymized and collected in a secure manner. The researchers also suggest that only companies larger than a certain size should be required to share data. Corporations that do not follow the rules should pay fines. The study appears in the middle of an important legislative process for the regulation of tech companies at European level: The consultation process of the European Commission for a Digital Services Act (DSA) is ongoing until early September. This regulation could impose various mandatory measures on the large tech companies in terms of transparency, dealing with criminal content and restricting their market power. Mackenzie Nelson of the German tech NGO AlgorithmWatch hopes that improved access to the data of the tech companies will also lead to better political decisions in the long term. \"The Media State Treaty is a German example that shows that internet regulation is not always based on scientific evidence,\" Nelson told SPIEGEL. However, in order for research on the topics to be possible, the scientists would also need access to the data. Nelson is skeptical about initiatives like Social Science One: \"Tech companies are introducing voluntary initiatives, which can be a good first step,\" says Nelson. \"But they often use this self-regulation to prevent sensible legal regulation.\" A Facebook spokeswoman said that the company is committed to promoting independent research. \"We have a number of programs that support scientists in different areas,\" said the spokeswoman. Currently, this also includes collaboration with researchers on Covid-19.\n",

            " The US Federal Reserve (Fed) has imposed strict conditions on US money houses to protect their capital resources. Stock repurchases and dividend increases are prohibited for the largest banks at least until the end of the third quarter, the Fed said on Thursday (local time). The Fed said that the institutes did well in the annual stress test. But an analysis of the burdens caused by the corona pandemic revealed risks. According to AP news agency, banks could lose up to $ 700 billion in loans based on a Fed worst-case scenario for the corona pandemic. A total of 34 banks were tested in the stress test. To prepare them for these possible losses, banks are expected to hold the money together over the next few months. The Fed guidelines were not well received by investors, and bank stocks initially reacted with exchange losses after the exchange. The certificates for the financial institutions were consistently positive in the first round of the regular annual stress test. \"The banking system remains well capitalized, even assuming the worst downside scenarios,\" Fed Vice Randal Quarles wrote in the release. \"The banking system has so far been a source of strength in this crisis.\" Deutsche Bank also participated in the stress test with its US subsidiary as one of the major foreign banks - successfully. The Fed has certified progress in the bank, according to the document released Thursday after the US market closed. Last year, Deutsche Bank passed the stress test for the first time in years. In 2018, 2017 and 2015, she was unable to convince the supervisors. \"For the second year in a row, our most important regulatory agency in the United States had neither quantitative nor qualitative objections to capital planning,\" wrote US chief Christiana Riley and Deutsche Bank chief Christian Sewing to the employees. This is good news and an important step forward for the bank. However, Deutsche Bank is not entirely exempt from the Fed's regulations. Unlike the rivals in the US, the dividends and share buybacks for the subsidiaries of foreign financial institutions do not depend on the test result, but the profit distributions to their corporate mothers do. The US Federal Reserve is putting the largest financial institutions through stress tests using simulated crisis scenarios to test their capital buffers. After the bad experiences in the last major financial crisis, it should be ensured that lending in the event of a financial market crash does not suddenly stall and that banks do not have to be rescued with tax money. Deutsche Bank is undergoing a multi-billion dollar renovation that will kill 18,000 jobs worldwide. Sewing has so far been confident in the corona crisis that the bank will survive the consequences of the pandemic without major injuries.\n",

            " The Federal Association of German Industry (BDI) has advocated the rapid introduction of a lobby register in Germany. Especially in an economic crisis like the current corona pandemic, a close exchange between those responsible in politics and those affected in the economy is essential, said President Dieter Kempf. \"It is all the more important to have maximum transparency in representing interests and passing on information from business to politics. There must be no impression of improper behavior.\" According to the BDI, such a transparency register must guarantee that all lobbyists disclose their activities in federal politics - both domestic and foreign lobbyists. It has to show the financial weight they bring. The register should not only apply to associations, but also to NGOs, lawyers and consultants. After the SPIEGEL revelations about the questionable lobbying activity of the CDU politician Philipp Amthor, the debate over a lobby register in Germany had gained momentum. The FDP, the Greens and the Left are vehemently calling for a legal lobby register, the SPD and the Union have so far not been able to agree. \"The finances are to be presented in the new national transparency register in exactly the same way as in the EU register,\" said the BDI. According to the association, the model for lobbying in the legislative process should be the European consultation procedure. Representation of interests in the EU is open and transparent.\n",

            " After almost two years, the fatal Ebola outbreak in the east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo has been declared over. \"Today we are celebrating the end of the crisis,\" said microbiologist Jean-Jacques Muyembe, who leads the fight against Ebola in the Congo. One of the main lessons of the outbreak was that the population had to be involved in the fight against the epidemic, said Africa chief of the World Health Organization (WHO), Matshidiso Moeti. That is also \"extremely relevant\" for the corona pandemic. According to the authorities, a total of 3,463 people were infected with Ebola in Eastern Congo, and 2,280 died. Fighting was extremely difficult as the virus spread to a region with poor infrastructure and poverty. Several militias in the area partially attacked helpers and clinics. In addition, there was great mistrust among parts of the population, accompanied by doubts about the existence of the virus. The Ebola virus causes, among other things, nausea, diarrhea and heavy bleeding. It is transmitted through body fluids. As with all infectious diseases, it is extremely important to identify and isolate infected people and their contacts early on in order to contain them. In addition, the first vaccines and experimental drugs are now available, which were also used in the Eastern Congo to treat the deadly virus. Despite the good news, the medical situation in the Central African country continues to cause concern. In the meantime, more than 6000 corona infections have been detected. There is also a new Ebola outbreak in the west of the country, more than 1,000 kilometers from the previously affected region. The new outbreak became known on June 1st. At least 17 people have become infected, eleven of them have died. Experts predict that the pathogen in the region in the west of the country will be easier to fight because it will affect a more politically stable part of the country. It is the eleventh Ebola outbreak in the Congo since the virus was discovered near the Ebola River in 1976. The viruses circulate, among other things, in fruit bats and can be passed on to humans, for example, when eating game meat. \"We remain extremely concerned about the country's weak health system and infrastructure,\" said Louis Dorvilier, country director of Welthungerhilfe. The country's director of the Care organization, Benoit Munsch, warned: \"There are many people in the east of the country who urgently need food, water and accommodation to survive. The health crises that make so many headlines are also becoming less important.\" The Ebola epidemic in Eastern Congo, now declared to be over, is said to be the second deadliest outbreak of the virus to be documented. The most serious one so far occurred in 2014/2015 in West Africa, at that time more than 11,000 people were killed, most of them in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.\n",

            " According to their own information, customs investigators have managed to strike a large blow against an international gang of suspected car pushers. During searches in Berlin, Brandenburg, Thuringia, Saxony and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, officials seized 25 high-quality vehicles. On behalf of the Berlin public prosecutor's office, arrest warrants were executed against twelve suspects, the authorities said. The investigators of the Berlin-Brandenburg customs investigation agency also secured cash, luxury watches and a high-quality motor yacht with a total value of more than 900,000 euros. The gang are said to have bought partially armored luxury vehicles in Russia since 2015 and have spent fake travel to Germany without paying customs clearance. As a result, the suspects between the ages of 25 and 52 should have applied for export license plates with manipulated papers at various registration offices. With these license plates, the vehicles were given a German vehicle registration certificate and were subsequently sold profitably on the private car market across Europe. According to the investigators, the tax damage amounts to more than three million euros. A total of 200 forces from the customs investigation offices in Berlin-Brandenburg, Hamburg, Dresden and Frankfurt am Main and the customs investigation office in Potsdam were involved in the action on Wednesday morning.\n",

            " Gerald Haug, the new president of the National Academy of Sciences Leopoldina, has traveled a lot in the past few months. On the train, of course, because the 52-year-old is a climate researcher. Haug made his inaugural visits, from the Federal President to the Prime Minister of Saxony-Anhalt. He spoke to business leaders and association presidents and toured throughout the republic despite the corona crisis. Haug liked to tell his conversation partners about the Pliocene warm period. That was over three million years ago. \"The northern hemisphere was ice-free and the sea level 20 meters higher.\" The Indian and East Asian monsoons were considerably weaker. The world climate is completely different. At that time, the concentration of carbon dioxide was roughly the same as the value that will be reached in twelve, maybe 15 years. \"We have to act now\" is the director's message at the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry in Mainz. Haug, in charge of the National Academy, has now submitted a study together with the Academy of Technical Sciences (Acatech) and the Union of German Academies of Sciences, which is intended as a \"compact handout\" for researchers for the Federal Government. It contains 15 pages on what the country's leading scientists believe the climate protection action to do in the German EU Council Presidency. The earth's atmosphere \"may no longer be used as an unrestricted landfill space for greenhouse gas emissions\", they write in a language that is relatively generally understandable for scholars. Climate protection is \"not a luxury problem for a few\", it says there, but \"an urgent human task\". The Leopoldina enjoys a high reputation right up to the top of the state, especially with Chancellor Angela Merkel, who gives a lot to the judgment of the time-honored community based in Halle. In the corona crisis, the specialist society presented a handful of short studies. The verdict, as Merkel put it at the time, would take her very seriously. With the same hope of having an effect, Haug and his fellow campaigners have now positioned themselves on climate protection and are publishing their comments on time for the coalition committee of the SPD and the Union taking place in the Chancellery this evening, which is about the German program for the EU Council Presidency. Responsible for the report are, among others, the economist Ottmar Edenhofer from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, the head of the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research, Anja Boetius, and the head of the Geological Research Center in Potsdam and acatech Vice, Reinhard Hüttl. In their advice, they differentiate between so-called no-regret measures, i.e. those things that are obvious technological necessities and can be implemented immediately. And those instruments that would be urgently needed but are difficult to implement politically, such as effective pricing of CO2 emissions on a European or global scale. The first category includes the expansion of photovoltaics and wind energy. \"The fundamental transformation of the energy system is technically possible,\" she said. For example, they want to turn the energy transition from a German to a European one. In addition, the entry into the hydrogen economy must be successful. The gas can not only serve as an energy source for aircraft, ships and heavy goods vehicles, but can also make industrial processes, such as the extraction of steel and chemicals, climate-neutral, provided that it is produced using green electricity. The Federal Government had to ensure in its Council Presidency that such a generation system of hydrogen from renewable energy would be set up in North Africa or Australia. It was important not to waste time. In the next ten years there would be a \"need for reinvestment between 30 and 60 percent\" in the steel, chemical and cement industries, the statement said. Systems of this size would remain in use for decades. If old, climate-damaging techniques were used now, effective climate protection would remain blocked \"for many decades\". Europe should serve \"as a global role model\", and the Germans should be brave in their presidency. This also includes setting a price on CO2 emissions for all processes that generate the greenhouse gas. This is \"the key instrument for climate protection,\" the authors write. Sectors such as transport or building energy must also be integrated, according to the science academies. Goods that are imported from outside the EU would have to be subject to a levy that corresponds to the CO2 emissions that were produced during its production in a third country than when it was manufactured in the EU. Projects like this are complicated, not only because they are fundamentally new, but also because they are difficult to implement on an international scale. Angela Merkel think many of the academy members are probably the only person in Germany and Europe who could implement reforms of this magnitude. The Chancellor heads the CDU, a party that has many influential concerns among its members against too much climate protection. But just as ex-Chancellor Gerhard Schröder probably managed to push through the Hartz reforms against his own party, the SPD workers' party, it could be Merkel's job to drive her conservative clientele to protect the earth's atmosphere. At least that's how influential members of the national science academies think. They do not see the corona crisis as an argument for less climate protection. \"The economic recovery should be geared towards sustainable defossilization and effective emission reduction,\" they write. The researchers see the \"political momentum\" given that they are now building an effective \"green deal\". \"This is the yardstick for the success of the German Presidency,\" says Leopoldina President Haug.\n",

The heavyweight world champion was never as helpless and without ideas as on this June 26, 1976. He has not landed a blow in several laps, his red gloves dangle dormantly while the Champ's nimble legs try to avoid the kicks. The booing and whistles get louder, cups and crumpled programs land in the ring. Meanwhile, the hematoma on Ali's leg is blooming, the ground attacks of the Japanese giant have an effect. All observers agree: the world has never seen a miserable struggle. How the hell was the greatest boxer ever got in there? Almost two years earlier, Ali is at the height of his career. At the legendary \"Rumble in the Jungle\" 1974 he recaptured the world championship title against the muscle mountain George Foreman. But the forced break from 1967 to 1971, which resulted from his iconic conscientious objection to military service (\"I ain't got no quarrel with them Vietcong!\"), Cost Ali not only the best years of his athletic life, but also a lot of money.

            " More than 800 souvenirs of famous musicians came under the hammer at Julien’s US auction house on Saturday. A satin dress worn by singer Madonna in her legendary \"Vogue\" video fetched almost $ 180,000, a belt decorated with rhinestones by Elvis Presley cost just under $ 300,000. But the crowning glory of the two-day \"Music Icons\" auction in Beverly Hills was undoubtedly Kurt Cobain's \"Unplugged\" guitar. The Nirvana frontman had bought the instrument in 1993 for only $ 5000 used. The Martin D-18E acoustic electric guitar has now been auctioned for a record price: The buyer paid $ 6.01 million including commission. This greatly exceeded the estimated one to two million dollars. The auction house was visibly enthusiastic about its own success: \"SOLD for $ 6,010,000! A new world record for a guitar\" was posted on Twitter alongside a photo of the instrument. The guitar was auctioned with the original hard case, which Cobain had decorated with a sticker.

The 62-year-old Swede doesn't want to lock the record guitar from 1959 in a safe, on the contrary. It is said to go on tour around the world with other Nirvana memorabilia for a good cause. His family had gotten rich through the music scene, said Freedman. Now he wants to use his foundation to help the needy artists in the corona pandemic with income from the guitar exhibition. \"So many friends have lost everything, their jobs, their savings, they need medical support, especially help with mental health problems,\" said the entrepreneur. He also wants to work for better protection for musicians. The starting bid for the guitar had been a million dollars before the bids at Julien's Auctions skyrocketed online and live in Beverly Hills. The exciting competition with bidders from all over the world dragged on for minutes, then the award for Freedman. \"I was willing to pay any price for the guitar,\" said the buyer. \"But my hands and legs were trembling totally.\" The previous auction record for a guitar was set by a 1969 Black Fender Stratocaster (\"The Black Strat\") by Pink Floyd frontman David Gilmour. A year ago, she went to an anonymous bidder for nearly $ 4 million. The guitar of grunge icon Cobain, who died in 1994, set five records, according to Julien's Auctions - among other things as the most expensive nirvana memorial and the most expensive acoustic guitar. Cobain played the instrument at his legendary \"MTV Unplugged\" appearance in New York in 1993, five months before his death. The live album, released in 1994, with songs such as \"About A Girl\" and \"Come As You Are\" won the Grammy in the category \"Best Alternative Music\". A guitar of the US pop star Prince, who died in 2016, changed hands for more than half a million dollars. The blue cloud guitar from 1984, the so-called \"Blue Angel\", was one of the Grammy Award winner's favorite instruments at the height of his career in the 1980s and 1990s. Prince played the instrument on big tours like \"Purple Rain\" or \"Lovesexy\".\n",

            " Germany's top consumer protection group has positioned itself against the temporary value-added tax cut planned in the federal government's stimulus package. \"As nice as the 20 billion euros in value-added tax cut read on paper: I do not expect any noticeable relief for everyone through this measure alone,\" said Klaus Müller, head of the Federation of German Consumer Organizations (VZBV), the \"Handelsblatt\". \"Restaurant and hotel associations as well as individual companies have already announced that they will not pass on the reductions to consumers at all or not in a linear fashion.\" Non-linear means: The reduced tax rate is not applied to all products. The temporary reduction in sales tax rates is to apply from July 1 to December 31, 2020. The tax rate is to be reduced from 19 to 16 percent during this period, and the reduced tax rate from seven to five percent. The VAT reduction is part of the so-called second Corona Tax Assistance Act, which is the subject of a public hearing by the Bundestag Finance Committee this Monday. \"From the point of view of the VZBV, it would make more sense to use the planned financial resources of 20 billion euros in such a way that consumers are actually relieved and that politics and consumers are not dependent on the goodwill of companies,\" says it in a statement from the association for the hearing, which is available to the \"Handelsblatt\". As an alternative, VZBV boss Müller suggests a greater reduction in the levy under the Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG) and thus lower electricity prices. The black-red coalition recently decided to relieve citizens and companies of the corona crisis in terms of electricity costs. To this end, the EEG surcharge is to be reduced from 2021 through grants from the federal budget. According to the plans, a household will save just ten euros on the electricity bill next year, said Müller. \"An economic stimulus will not be expected.\" The estimated 20 billion euros for the reduction in value added tax would be better invested in a much stronger reduction in the EEG surcharge. \"Supplemented with a children's bonus of 600 instead of 300 euros, this would be more effective and also more socially just.\"\n",

            " Technology makes life better? Just a few minutes in a passenger seat in Night City is enough to question that. In the fictional California megacity, the world is highly technical in 2077, but broken. Large corporations and gangs pull the strings, crime is omnipresent. Steam rises from gullies, streets are full of rubbish and homeless. The city is reminiscent of a decaying Los Angeles or a Silicon Valley test field marked by war and conflict. The residents therefore like to use a technology called braindance to relive the emotions and experiences of others - and thus escape their own sad life. Night City is known for the pen & paper title \"Cyberpunk 2020\" by the US author Mike Pondsmith. So far, the place has mainly existed in the fantasy of living room role-playing players. The Polish studio CD Projekt Red, famous for the excellent \"The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt\" and notorious for its working conditions, now brings it digitally to life in \"Cyberpunk 2077\". From November, Night City should be explored in the video game on foot or by car. \"Cyberpunk 2077\" was announced in 2012 and recently postponed twice - for many game fans it will be the most interesting blockbuster of the fall. But will the game live up to the high expectations? And how finished does it already look? At a press event - including a face mask and controller disinfection - it was possible to try it out this week. Transparency notice: \"Cyberpunk 2077\" is expected to be released on November 19, 2020 for the PC, Playstation 4 and Xbox One. The game is also said to be playable on Playstation 5 and Xbox One, which are due to be released at the end of the year. A streaming variant for Google Stadia is also planned. SPIEGEL was shown a pre-English version of the game at a press event. In around four hours, our author played part of the prologue for \"Cyberpunk 2077\" himself, and in addition a developer showed him other missions and functions. The game ran on site on a gaming PC, which was equipped with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Ti, among other things. There were hardly any loading times on this high-end device and there were no performance drops. The console versions of \"Cyberpunk 2077\" were not playable on site, but the PC version was controlled with an Xbox One controller. All pictures shown in this article are official screenshots of the manufacturer. Own screenshots could not be taken. I was able to test the prologue of the game, which begins with character creation, as is typical of roleplaying games. The main person named V, through whom you experience the action from a first-person perspective, can be individualized in many ways - from the skin and hair color to the genital area. Vs with a masculine body shape can also have a female voice and feminine-looking Vs a male. For this purpose, attribute points are distributed in categories such as body, intelligence and technical skills. There are also three background stories to choose from, including that of the \"Street Kid\". As such a milieu survivor, I started my adventure. From a dingy bar, the hunt for a rare car soon began. The game introduction also includes a tutorial in which the basic functions of \"Cyberpunk 2077\" are introduced to the players, including shooting, sneaking and hacking. This training, staged as a virtual reality experience for V, shows what was foreseeable: \"Cyberpunk 2077\" like \"Detroit: Become Human\" offers an interactive story with different courses - but the game is also gameplay remarkably complex. It will take time to penetrate his world and mechanics. The world of \"Cyberpunk 2077\": Shooting, sneaking, hacking What fascinated me about playing on the one hand was the dark, dystopian basic feeling that Night City conveys: the feeling of being trapped in a transhumanist dream gone wrong by presumably only doing it The richest and most powerful are doing well - as long as they hide how the world around them perishes. It was also interesting how varied \"Cyberpunk 2077\" works. Missions can be completed in different ways and with different play styles. You can shoot your way through a building full of enemies. But you can also hack the environment or sneak up and silently kill your opponents in a non-lethal manner. V is how I want it - daredevil, super careful or alternating between the two. In general, it is always important to make small and large decisions. When suddenly a gangster with a gun is in the car window and it's about survival, but also when a homeless person asks for a donation. In terms of the environment, Night City is the biggest break from \"The Witcher 3\". The metropolis is densely populated and densely built up, there are dark backyards, but also gigantic blocks of flats where there is always something going on. The population is also more diverse: Whites and people of color live in the tech juggernaut, women and men, but also children, are on the streets. The interiors that were previously accessible looked very detailed, although it was sometimes difficult to assess which part of the interior can be interacted with. When in doubt, the rule was: with fewer objects than expected. \"Cyberpunk 2077\" is obviously not one of those role-playing games in which the main character immediately carries everything that is not riveted and nail-proof. Compared to other open world games like \"Grand Theft Auto V\", the game is more story driven and less like a digital playground to let off steam and hang out. You can also watch the day and night change from a house roof or start a shootout at a busy intersection. \"Cyberpunk 2077\" seems to be designed to deal with the tasks developed by the development team. In the \"Street Kid\" narrative, there are initially a few longer phases of dialogue that you experience, among other things, as a car passenger. In general, be prepared to listen to non-player characters for a while. Fortunately, the dialogues, the musical settings and the facial animations of the game are convincing. After four hours, the impression remains that \"Cyberpunk 2077\" has rightly received many advance laurels. It will only become clear, however, whether the game will be able to offer as much playful freedom in the long run as is initially promised: Whether the approach as a hacker, which probably often confronts you with the same logic mini-game, is similarly similar It's going to be fun, like a tactic designed for close combat and firearms. Or whether certain game variants emerging from the many possibilities turn out to be rather boring. In any case, the developers have a lot to balance. The direction and quality of the main story is also difficult to assess. As far as the game world is concerned, the makers still had to tackle some typical Open World construction sites until November: In my test, for example, figures sometimes ran into each other or into parts of the surroundings. With the settings shown to me, the game was HUD-heavy at the beginning, meaning: display elements such as a mini-map, explanatory notes and information on the status of V were quite present. Unlike some other games, this does not necessarily lead to an immersion break in \"Cyberpunk 2077\": The fact that the game simulates a world in which many people - like in the game V, too - can upgrade their bodies with so-called cyberware Fade-in overflow more easily with the experience.\n",

            " In addition to the planned closure of dozen branches of the department store chain Galeria Karstadt Kaufhof, many branches of the subsidiary Karstadt Sports are being closed. According to the dpa news agency, 20 of the 30 branches will be closed, as SPIEGEL learned from an insider, including the branches in Wiesbaden, Frankfurt am Main, Kiel, Munich, Cologne, Hanau, the Hamburg branch in Mönckebergstraße, Rosenheim, Düsseldorf and Norderstedt. The management of the affected branches was informed on Saturday afternoon. The negotiations had lasted until early morning, according to dpa. The management of Galeria Karstadt Kaufhof had described the measures on Friday as inevitable. \"We know what this means for the employees concerned. But this step is without an alternative, because these branches endanger the entire existence of the company,\" said the general representative Arndt Geiwitz. Ultimately, it is about securing Galeria Karstadt Kaufhof and thus many thousands of jobs. On Friday, the department store group announced the closure of a total of 62 of its 172 department stores. According to the general works council, a total of 5317 employees will lose their jobs. The group currently has 28,000 employees. The group plans to close branches in 47 cities. People gathered in front of some branches in Berlin on Saturday morning to demonstrate against the planned closure. Six of eleven department stores are to be closed in the capital. According to the union, around 1000 of the approximately 2100 employees could be affected. In view of the announced closure of dozens of branches of the department store chain Galeria Karstadt Kaufhof, municipalities and politicians are warning of the extinction of inner cities. The property owners play a central role in this. The center manager ECE as one of the big landlords announced further talks. \"As long as nothing is finally decided, we want to try to continue negotiating with Karstadt Kaufhof and to fight for the locations,\" said Steffen Eric Friedlein, Managing Director of ECE's rental, in Hamburg on Saturday. Twelve of the Group's 172 locations are - often for decades - in various shopping centers operated by ECE and are largely affected by the closure plans.\n",

            " Progress in the peace process for eastern Ukraine has stagnated. The EU has therefore again extended its economic sanctions against Russia by half a year. The heads of state and government of the European Union agreed on this at a video conference, as Chancellor Angela Merkel said. The EU last extended trade and investment restrictions in December to July 31, despite billions in losses for domestic companies. They should now apply until January 31, 2021. After a summit in Paris last December, after years of standing still, there had actually been hope for progress in the peace process. Recently, however, the implementation of the resolutions of the meeting in the so-called Normandy format had stalled. So far, two arrangements for prisoner exchanges between Kiev and the breakaway Donetsk and Luhansk areas have been carried out under the agreements. The agreement also included a new ceasefire and the establishment of three new front sections for a troop withdrawal. Government troops have been fighting against separatist-backed Russians in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions since 2014. According to UN estimates, around 13,200 people have been killed since then. According to the current EU decision, Russia can only hope that economic sanctions will be lifted if the Minsk peace plan agreements on the conflict in Ukraine are fully fulfilled. By linking the sanctions to the peace plan, the EU states want to persuade Russian President Vladimir Putin to use his influence on the pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine more to resolve the conflict. According to diplomats, experts assume that the sanctions have already cost Russia a triple-digit billion amount. However, the economy in Germany and Europe is also affected, which is why business representatives have repeatedly appealed for easing. On the one hand, the punitive measures make it difficult for many EU companies to trade with Russia. On the other hand, Moscow in return has imposed bans on imports of western agricultural products such as fruit and meat. The EU punitive measures were introduced after the crash of a Malaysian plane with 298 people on board over eastern Ukraine in July 2014. According to Western investigators, it was shot down by pro-Russian separatists.\n",

            " It is a sad record: Wirecard shares fell by almost 80 percent after it became known that the payment processor had to file for bankruptcy. In the meantime, the paper was only worth 2.45 euros. No DAX company has ever plunged this deep in one day. Thursday was just the culmination of a development that had been going on for days: a week ago, the paper cost more than 100 euros, in February it was even more than 140 euros. It is \"a disaster,\" says Marc Tüngler, chief executive of the DSW investors' association. \"The system failed at Wirecard\". The speed of development suggests \"that the problems are much larger than previously known\". It is already clear that the scandal surrounding the former stock market star will go down in history and investors may cost a lot of money. For days now, the phone has barely stopped at lawyers across Germany. \"13,500 shareholders have now registered with us in the law firm to inquire about their chances of being compensated,\" says Tübingen capital market expert and lawyer Andreas Tilp. \"When bankruptcy became known today, 99 emails came in just a minute.\" Tilp made a request a long time ago for what is known as a model investor procedure, in which key legal questions and facts with binding effect are to be decided for thousands of plaintiffs. After all, the problems at Wirecard have not only been known since June 18, when the auditor EY failed to certify the 2019 financial statements. There has been cause for concern for years: In February 2016, the report of a platform called Zatarra appeared on the Internet, in which wild allegations were made against Wirecard. Later, the Financial Times repeatedly published critical articles. And again and again Wirecard rejected the criticism, investigations on suspicion of market manipulation followed, among other things because hedge funds had bet against Wirecard parallel to the publication of the Zatarra report. Tilp nevertheless believes that investors' claims for damages go back to the publication of the serious report. So that there are also claims for shareholders who have bought paper at some point since then and thus suffered damage. In the application for a model proceeding, Wirecard accuses the lawyer of repeatedly violating the so-called ad hoc obligation, that is to say that it did not publish news relevant to the stock exchange. It is primarily about so-called corporate governance violations. Violations of good corporate governance, which he believes should have been investigated and made public. Wirecard does not want to comment on this on request. Insolvency, of course, significantly reduced the chance of getting anything for shareholders from Wirecard. \"If Wirecard were actually to be settled, the shareholders would have to put their claims - if they are entitled - in the line of creditors. And in that line they would be pretty far behind,\" says Christoph Schalast, professor of business law, among other things the Frankfurt School of Finance. \"In front of them, for example, are all the banks to which collateral has been assigned. If you then consider that a typical bankruptcy procedure will satisfy less than ten percent of the claims, you can quickly see how much is left for the shareholders.\" However, the processing of Wirecard is not yet sealed: in Germany there are various forms of insolvency proceedings, some of which also allow for restructuring. Nevertheless, as a precaution, attorney Tilp also wants to target even more opponents: he wants to expand the model procedure application - to ex-Wirecard boss Markus Braun, two other managers, and to Wirecard's long-time auditor: EY (formerly: Ernst & Young). A few days ago, he pulled the ripcord and refused to certify the 2019 annual accounts. But now there is the question of whether the degrees were justly approved. Berlin lawyer Wolfgang Schirp has therefore already filed several lawsuits against EY, \"Wirecard's insolvency has already emerged,\" he says. EY had \"culpably\" audited the 2018 balance sheet, even though this conclusion had already shown that the company's cash holdings were more than one billion euros high, it says, among other things. Apparently, in previous years, EY relied on balance and account confirmations that may have been fake. Not only lay people wonder how this can happen with such large sums. \"An auditor who audits annual accounts is not an investigator: he first assumes the legality of the evidence submitted and only checks it randomly and risk-based,\" says Edgar Löw, also a professor at the Frankfurt School of Finance and a specialist in accounting . \"However, I am already asking myself to what extent the auditors should not have looked more closely at the ongoing negative reports on Wirecard and should have initiated forensic investigations on their own, as they were later carried out by the KPMG.\" The EY competitor's special test report on Wirecard at the end of April had not been able to completely dispel doubts regarding transactions with third parties, among other things, and had already caused the share to plummet. EY said on Thursday that Wirecard was expecting \"extensive fraud\". Lawyer Schirp is convinced that the case \"is painted to pre-exercise the auditor's liability in court\". This liability is \"indisputable in the literature\". Not only the injured shareholders are eligible, but also all investors who subscribed to the Wirecard AG bond issued in 2019, as well as the holders of derivatives. The investor lawyer Klaus Nieding, who is exploring options for 40 institutional investors, such as insurers or pension funds, now wants to examine not only Wirecard but also options against individual managers and against EY. But what are the chances of such lawsuits? Comparable processes in the past are missing - the Wirecard scandal is unique in its dimension. The complaining lawyers refer, among other things, to the nineties, when the Flowtex group from the small town of Ettlingen in Baden had sold non-existent special drilling machines for tunnel construction and had caused billions in damage. At that time, it was KPMG, the auditor, who was also criticized - he was also accused of failing to provide expert reports and audit reports. The company prevented a protracted legal battle simply by contributing 100 million euros to the compensation of Flowtex shareholders. Even if it continued to reject the allegations. Legal expert Schalast assumes that, in addition to EY, a number of other protagonists are also threatened with claims for damages. \"In the end, it will depend on where you can get the most - where, for example, so-called D&O insurance policies, that is, managers' liability insurance policies.\" However, this knowingly breach of duty and deliberate damage usually rule out. Even fund companies that had held large stocks of Wirecard shares until recently, or bank advisors who advised late on investing, could be targeted by investor lawyers, Schalast believes. \"And they will sue Wirecard and EY again because they trusted their information. A huge carousel of lawsuits will start.\" In fact, many large fund companies have relied on Wirecard for a long time, although the critical newspaper reports on possible irregularities have piled up. For example, the Deutsche Bank subsidiary DWS had invested 9.2 percent of the funds in Wirecard shares in its flagship fund DWS Germany at the end of October 2019. At the end of May, the total investment of all of the asset manager's German and Luxembourg funds in Wirecard shares was still EUR 298 million, although a number of share packages had already been sold in the spring. Other funds, for example from Union Investment or Deka-Bank, have long relied on the supposed stock market star. No wonder: Many a bank analyst certified the share a potential of more than 200 euros this year. DWS therefore already declared several days ago that it would also take legal action against Wirecard and ex-Braun board. Even if the impact on the performance of the funds concerned is \"limited\", as the asset manager emphasizes.\n",

            " Sometimes a short message is enough to awaken memories. It was an email from lawyer Matthias Waldraff that arrived on New Year's Eve last year. He, Waldraff, had no conscience, no scruples, wrote a stranger. He was a pig because he represented \"this person\". \"This person\" is what Ismet H. means, his case began in 1981, almost 40 years ago. In summer 2015 he was back in court, the judges pronounced a judgment that \"goes to the pain limit of our sense of justice,\" says Matthias Waldraff in his law firm in Hanover. It is a case that now even concerns the federal government. On the night of November 4, 1981, 17-year-old Frederike von M. was raped and murdered in a forest near Hambuehren. The perpetrator stabbed her seven times in the hip and twice in the chest. Her throat was cut. The then 22-year-old Ismet H. quickly became a suspect. Less than eight months after the crime, the Lüneburg jury sentenced him to life imprisonment for murder. The Federal Court of Justice overturned the judgment after H.'s defense lawyer went into revision. In a second trial, the Stade Ismet H. District Court finally acquitted. The reasoning stated that the taking of evidence did not indicate \"that the accused was at the scene at the time of the crime\".

            " The usual increase in old-age benefits could turn out in western Germany in the coming year. In the east, there will probably only be a slight increase of 0.7 percent. This is the assessment of Alexander Gunkel, CEO of Deutsche Rentenversicherung. According to the current status, it can be assumed that pensions in the West will not rise in the coming year, he said at the Federal Representatives' Meeting of Pension Insurance. A final decision on the pension adjustment by July 1, 2021 will not be made until next year. The federal government usually sets the annual adjustment in the spring by ordinance. The Federal Council must agree. The most recent increase in pensions was in 2010, the year after the financial crisis. Since then, pensions have risen annually, sometimes sharply. As of July this year, the approximately 21 million pensioners will also get more: 4.2 percent in the east and 3.45 percent in the west. The basis for the annual adjustment is, among other things, the wage development in the previous year. The assumptions now assume that average wages will fall and that the number of contributors will decrease, said Gunkel, referring to the corona crisis. At the same time, he pointed out that reductions in pensions due to a protective clause are excluded by law. The pension insurance explains the likely slight increase in the east compared to the possible zero round in the west with the so-called adjustment staircase: by 2024, the pension value in the east will be gradually adjusted to that in the west until it has reached 100 percent. The corona crisis is likely to affect not only pensioners, but also contributors, according to pension insurance. According to their forecast, the contribution rate will remain constant at 18.6 percent in 2021, said Gunkel. However, the level will not be able to be maintained until 2024, as was assumed before the corona crisis. The contribution rate could, according to the statements, rise before 2024 and probably reach 20 percent by 2025. At 20 percent, a so-called stop line has moved in by law, the rate must not continue to rise until 2025. In the aftermath, a commission of employer and trade union representatives, academics and specialist politicians had submitted reform proposals. (Read a summary here and a comment here). Social Minister Hubertus Heil (SPD) then announced that he would like to tackle a long-term pension reform this year. Gunkel said that the strong increase in short-time work and the increased unemployment as a result of the pandemic had a limited impact on pension insurance, since at least 80 percent of previous earnings were paid for short-time work, and the Federal Employment Agency paid pension insurance contributions to recipients of unemployment benefits I pay. For 2020, Gunkel anticipates a deficit in the pension fund of around 4.3 billion euros.\n",

This also applies to the administration, management and top management, as the district of Gütersloh announced. Some employees can, however, according to the information in so-called work quarantine. This means that they can only move between their place of work and their place of residence. This also applies to Clemens Tönnies, partner in Germany's largest slaughterhouse, as a group spokesman for the German Press Agency said. On Sunday there will be a special meeting of the North Rhine-Westphalian cabinet because of the outbreak in the group. If necessary, further measures will then be debated there. Previously, 7,000 people had been quarantined. The district of Gütersloh even asked the Bundeswehr for help in order to test the employees in rows. By Friday afternoon, 3500 tests had been carried out, 803 results were positive and 463 negative, the rest were still pending. The outbreak has serious consequences for the entire region: schools and day-care centers in the district are dense again, and anger is growing among the population. The city of Osnabrück in Lower Saxony ordered a two-week domestic quarantine for all Tönnies employees who live in the city. Osnabrück is around 60 kilometers from Rheda-Wiedenbrück.\n",

Wirecard, on the other hand, sees itself as a victim on Thursday evening and fears a \"gigantic\" billions of euros.

He was responsible for day-to-day business. Driven by speculation about bankruptcy, the decline in the share price continued on the stock exchange on Friday before the CEO resigned. In the course of the morning, the paper in Frankfurt again lost almost half of its value and was only trading at around 20 euros - on Wednesday evening, a Wirecard share was still worth over 100 euros. The company threatens to lose billions of lines of credit. If Wirecard does not submit its audited annual and consolidated financial statements this Friday, these could be terminated. The company announced this on Thursday. The investigations by the Munich public prosecutor's office continue despite the upheavals. \"We are investigating Wirecard as a whole, including the current events,\" a spokeswoman said on Friday.

            " Visiting a restaurant in the times of the coronavirus pandemic includes many things that are so far unfamiliar: some restaurateurs require a reservation, it is often served with a plastic visor on their face, in some restaurants the menu is only available on a copied slip of paper, which is disposed of after every guest. Protective masks are mandatory when walking through the restaurant and the tables are further apart than usual. And in many federal states there is something else that is always sparking anger: the obligation to register guests. The restaurant visitors leave a form with their contact details. If a person among the people in the restaurant tests positive for the new type of coronavirus, the health authorities can use the data they have left to identify and contact other people at risk. Some guests resist to leave their data. There are more and more guests who find the specifications made by the authorities disturbing, according to the trade union food-pleasure-restaurants (NGG). \"Of course, those who work in direct contact with the guests get displeasure, especially and first. The spectrum ranges from annoyed rolling eyes to insults,\" says NGG spokesman Jonas Bohl. For the employees, this is not an easy situation and a high additional one But even the restaurateurs don't always behave as the authorities demand. Johannes Caspar, the highest data protection officer of the city of Hamburg, has had his employees checked. 100 locations in the city center, in the Schanzenviertel and in the Altona / Ottensen district The data security officers were visited, including 97 restaurants, two bakeries and a hairdresser. The focus of the sample was to find establishments that use lists for guest recording that are open and accessible to everyone. According to the test, around one in three shops examined were found to be illegal against the requirements of the city. 33 of the audited companies had for the contact data processing lists that were open on the counter, on the tables or at the entrance. The remaining companies adhered to the regulations and worked in compliance with data protection regulations, for example via apps or single sheets, which were collected immediately. The real problem should only start now. In many places, the retention period is four weeks. Then the address data must be destroyed - safely. \"Simply throwing it away is not enough,\" says data protection officer Caspar. Also, restaurateurs would have to set up a kind of resubmission system in order to destroy personal data after exactly four weeks. Another risk for guests: your data will be misused for other purposes Collection is also a great temptation, because at last they could know who their customers really are - in theory. Because practically that is not allowed. \"The data can really only be used for this, if necessary - ie upon official request - a follow-up around this To enable corona virus, ”says Caspar. But that should be difficult to control. Caspar knows of a case from before the corona virus, in which even a police officer used contact information for a quick flirt. \"An official had used the data collected for other reasons inappropriately. Of course that is not possible and we imposed a fine,\" says lawyer Caspar. For example, it is conceivable that a restaurant employee would like to invite a guest privately for a coffee - that would also be a clear violation of data protection and could be punished. The Hamburg authorities had to clarify a similar case just at a fast food shop. Here you can find external content that complements the article. You can view it with a click leave and hide again.\n",

            " Caspar's authority could also impose fines for lists that do not comply with data protection laws. \"At the first inspection, we refrained from doing so and instructed the restaurateurs. The industry has been hit hard enough and is bleeding out,\" says the head of the agency. However, if you would see similar violations during another inspection, there could be no excuse. \"And we will continue to control, ”says Caspar. The penalties could be huge, up to four percent of annual sales are conceivable. Caspar's advice to guests who value the protection of their personal information: provide as little data as possible. \"It is enough to leave a possibility, either an email address, address or telephone number,\" says Caspar. Restaurateurs would also have to explain exactly what the data is collected for and point out that not all of the forms have to be filled in. NGG-Mann, too Bohl sees a colorful picture among the members. \"There are companies in which the official requirements relating to Corona are strictly implemented, but also others where the requirements are now being ignored,\" he says. There are also companies that use the contact details obtained to contact guests afterwards. Bohl's conclusion: \"The hospitality industry is a broad field - from very small businesses to large hotel chains. The way they operate is correspondingly different.\"\n",

Borasio: According to our draft, only doctors can carry out suicide help. It is punishable for everyone else. The only exception: relatives or other related persons. University of Lausanne Gian Domenico Borasio is considered one of the pioneers of palliative medicine in Germany. He has been head of the palliative care department at the University Clinic of Lausanne since 2011. He teaches end of life medicine in Germany and Switzerland. The co-authors of the proposed law are palliative medicine doctor and medical ethicist Ralf Jox (Lausanne), medical lawyer Jochen Taupitz (Heidelberg) and medical ethicist Urban Wiesing (Tübingen). SPIEGEL: Why doctors? Borasio: Because only they have the professional qualifications. The difficulty of accompanying a person who is willing to commit suicide can be compared to heart surgery. Not everyone is allowed to do this, not even every doctor. A family doctor, an oncologist or an internist, for example, often knows his patients very well. If someone says to him: I no longer like, I want to die, he can assess whether there is a cry for help, a temporary mood or a long-matured decision. If he is unsure, he will - depending on the situation - consult a geriatrician or psychiatrist. Or a pastor, a psychotherapist, a social worker. But in the end it is the doctor who prescribes the deadly remedy, and he is also responsible for it. SPIEGEL: Doesn't the right to self-determination also include the free choice of helpers? Borasio: Yes, but the state can restrict this choice as part of its care mandate. The Constitutional Court formulated what I believe to be a somewhat heroic idea of ​​the principle of autonomy: the ideal is the person who puts an end to his life in a completely free decision. But this is about seriously suffering people - physically, mentally. Most of them are sick, old, fragile. You decide under great suffering. The Constitutional Court's ruling rightly also speaks of influences that can endanger a free decision. Here the legislature can and should set up protection guidelines. SPIEGEL: What do you have to protect against suicide? Borasio: For example, before they commit suicide under the influence of a treatable mental illness. Or hastily. We therefore have a waiting period of ten days. Or before they make a non-free decision because nobody offers them the help to which they have a right: someone who listens actively, gives competent information, shows alternatives, such as palliative medicine, pain therapy, better care and so on. And at the end of the accompaniment, the patient must also have the option of receiving suicide help. SPIEGEL: Euthanasia clubs would be prohibited? Borasio: No, there is no need for that - and it would also be incompatible with the constitutional judgment. In Germany, euthanasia organizations are partially demonized. Based on my experience in Switzerland, where I have been working for nine years, I cannot understand that. In some Swiss cantons, they can also provide suicide assistance in nursing homes and hospitals. SPIEGEL: According to your proposal, what would euthanasia groups be allowed to do? Borasio: You shouldn't advertise suicide help, but if you want to support those who want to commit suicide with information about which doctor is nearby, then there is nothing to be said against it. But it is problematic if you take this into your own hands. Only this morning I found out again in a meeting that members of an euthanasia club told a patient with cancer and severe pain that she should not take morphine, otherwise she would be unable to work and could no longer get suicide help from them. A blatant misinformation, because correctly applied morphine does not make patients incapable of doing business. Our model would prevent such errors. SPIEGEL: Do you think doctors can continue to do the same as the now deceased Berlin death helper Uwe-Christian Arnold, one of the plaintiffs against the ban on suicide? Borasio: Not without further ado. According to our legislative proposal, each doctor must consult at least a second, independent colleague. The four-eyes principle is very important to us. If doctors come together in an euthanasia association, this would be allowed according to our model. Perhaps it would still happen that a death helper traveled from Hamburg to Freiburg, but not often. Because, data from other countries tell us, people prefer to go to the doctor they trust. And if he can't or doesn't want to, he'll refer you to a colleague. SPIEGEL: In Switzerland, the law has been freeing doctors to provide this help for decades. This did not make the euthanasia organizations superfluous. Borasio: It also has to do with the culture of Switzerland. Many doctors there are happy that the clubs do this work for them. But there are also doctors who provide suicide help themselves. As early as 2010, 37 percent of doctors in Germany said that if they were clearly regulated, they would provide suicide help. Today there are probably more. There are more than 400,000 doctors in Germany who do not count retired people. We come to at least 150,000 doctors who would be willing to do that. SPIEGEL: And would that be compatible with the medical ethics? The guidelines of the German Medical Association state that suicide aid is not a medical task. Borasio: Providing suicide help or not remains the decision of each doctor's conscience. Therefore, we also state in the bill that no one is obliged to help them commit suicide. SPIEGEL: Should suicide aid be a cash benefit? Borasio: As a complex medical service, you should get your own billing number. Remuneration should be set in such a way that there is no incentive to do business with it. SPIEGEL: How many medically assisted suicides do you expect for Germany in the medium term? Borasio: In the US state of Oregon, where only doctors are allowed to help with suicide, this affects 0.4 percent of all deaths. In Switzerland 1.5 percent. With around 900,000 deaths annually in Germany, one would perhaps get 8,000 to 10,000. Not immediately, but in a few years. SPIEGEL: Before commercial suicide assistance was banned, it was more like 100 to 200 cases a year. What could you read from such an increase? Borasio: Nothing can be read from the number alone. According to the Federal Constitutional Court, the state is also not entitled to evaluate this morally. All the more important is a documentation and reporting obligation. The more you know about age, illness, social circumstances, motives, the better. If we saw, for example, that - unlike in Oregon so far - more and more elderly people from underprivileged social groups are taking advantage of suicide help out of loneliness or fear of long-term care, then we as a society would have to ask ourselves some urgent questions. The best thing for the state to do immediately is to improve the living conditions of these people so that it doesn't get that far. Are you thinking about taking your own life? Talk to other people about it. Here you will find - also anonymous - offers of help in supposedly hopeless situations. By phone, chat, email or in person.\n",

            " There are complaints about a difficult Abitur every year, but in the past few weeks they have achieved a new quality: For the first time, not only parents and students have complained about the math tasks, the Saxon Ministry of Culture now announced - but also teachers . So the Ministry raised the grade point average to get to the bottom of the matter and noted a significant deterioration. In the advanced course, the test subjects only got an average of 3.1 - in the previous year the average was 2.5. Minister of Culture Christian Piwarz is now taking consequences. The math grades would be raised by one point, he said. For comparison: Nine points on the grading scale of the upper level correspond to the school grade 2.9 to 3.1, ten points the grade 2.6 to 2.8.

            " The decision apparently has only a marginal connection with the corona crisis. This year Saxony has taken over more tasks unchanged from the common task pool of the states, which is why the test subjects had to deal with unusual wording. The ministry apparently did not communicate the new requirements for exam preparation adequately, according to the self-critical assessment. In addition, the teachers could no longer support and prepare the high school graduates so well at the beginning of the crisis. Piwarz said he wanted to stand by his word that the students would not be disadvantaged by the fact that the Abi exams took place as planned, despite Corona. Shortly after the introduction of corona protective measures in March, the ministers of culture had decided that the Abi should still be written. Students in several federal states petitioned for a so-called average high school diploma. But in the end the tests took place everywhere. However, federal education minister Anja Karliczek, who is largely powerless when it comes to Abitur, called for mildness: If the average Abitur is worse this year than usual, one should talk about an appreciation of the grades.\n",

            " Don't miss anything: Subscribe to our Coronavirus newsletter for the latest developments and key background information. 11:23 p.m .: Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammed Shtaje has announced new restrictions due to a new rise in corona infections in the West Bank. In the particularly affected cities of Hebron and Nablus, bans have been imposed. Shtaje appealed to the Palestinian people to wear masks and abide by distance rules. Weddings may no longer be held for the time being. The pandemic in the Palestinian Territories had been extremely light so far. Restrictions had largely been lifted almost a month ago. However, the number of infections has risen steadily in recent days. According to the Ministry of Health, there are 711 known cases of coronavirus infections in the West Bank, more than 70 in the Gaza Strip, and three people died. 10:15 p.m .: A few hours before his appearance in front of a mass audience in Oklahoma, six members of Donald Trump's campaign team were found to have a corona infection. Nobody is said to have had contact with the US President. 8:25 p.m .: The number of reproductions on Saturday rose by leaps and bounds. According to an estimate by the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), the value is now 1.79 - well above the critical mark of 1. On Friday, the RKI had given the reproduction number R as 1.06. The reason for the increase are several corona outbreaks in Germany, including the Tönnies meat factory in the Gütersloh district. There, more than 1000 people have now tested positive for the virus. The value indicates how many more people are infected on average by an infected person. If R is greater than 1, the number of infections continues to increase. If it is less than 1, it will decrease. The RKI has repeatedly emphasized that in order to let the epidemic subside, the number of reproductions must be below 1. 7:28 p.m .: Federal Education Minister Anja Karliczek still does not believe that full return to normal school operations after the summer holidays is certain. \"The virus is not gone, and we have to reckon with the fact that schools have to be closed if someone gets infected there,\" said the CDU politician of the \"Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung\". How fragile the situation is can be seen in North Rhine-Westphalia. \"We must continue to act with caution.\" In the meantime, the federal states are striving to return to normal operations after the summer vacation. \"I very much hope that the infection will allow this development,\" said Karliczek. However, the past few weeks have shown how important regular and personal contact between students and teachers is. Homeschooling has \"very clear limits,\" said the Minister of Education. \"That's why face-to-face teaching naturally keeps its meaning. Without ifs and buts. But school and lessons are becoming more digital overall.\" 18.07 clock: In Russia, the football season has continued after a three-month break due to the corona pandemic. The first fans of the Premier League were also allowed to return to the stadiums. 1500 spectators watched the match Ural Yekaterinburg against Rubin Kazan on Saturday, according to the Tass State Agency. To protect against infection, only ten percent of the seats in the stands may be occupied for the time being. The game ended 2-1 (1-1). 6:03 p.m .: Residents of a building complex in quarantine in Göttingen have thrown objects at police officers and injured several. Some residents have also tried to overcome protective fences installed by the city, the police said. The city of Göttingen had previously quarantined around 700 people. Since Thursday, nearly 120 people have been diagnosed with the novel corona virus. According to the authorities, more than 200 children and adolescents live in precarious living conditions in the residential complex. The city of Göttingen had started the tests of the residents on Saturday. As a spokesman for the city said, those who had a negative result in the first major test campaign should be re-examined for corona infection in the afternoon. 17:56: After the serious virus outbreak in a Tönnies slaughterhouse in the district of Gütersloh, CEO Clemens Tönnies refuses to resign. \"I will lead this company out of the crisis,\" he said. \"I don't make myself out of the dust.\" He rejected criticism that his company had been reluctant to disclose employee data. In the company, the number of employees infected with Corona had previously risen to 1,029. District Administrator Sven-Georg Adenauer had criticized that the Tönnies company had not been able to provide all addresses of employees, including sub-companies, by Friday evening. 4:42 pm: The Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis has stopped a clinical study with the malaria agent hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of coronavirus infections. The reason was a lack of study participants, the company said late Friday evening. The clinical team was hardly able to collect meaningful data within a reasonable period of time. Hydroxychloroquine and the related substance chloroquine have traditionally been used to treat malaria. Novartis announced in April that it would fund a phase 3 clinical trial in the United States. The FDA had approved the study, but withdrew a special approval for the use of hydroxychloroquine against Covid-19 in mid-June. After weeks of scientific and political controversy, the World Health Organization (WHO) also discontinued clinical studies on the use of hydroxychloroquine against severe coronavirus infections this week. 4:25 p.m .: Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez called on his compatriots to exercise further caution on the last day of the Corona emergency. \"The virus can come back and we could be hit by a second wave of infections,\" he said on a television speech on Saturday. \"For this reason, everyone must continue to strictly adhere to the hygiene and health rules,\" warned the socialist. At midnight, the emergency in Spain ends after 98 days and the last remnants of the drastic restrictions on personal freedom of movement for the 47 million citizens of the country are also eliminated. More than 28,000 people died with Covid-19. Sánchez defended the controversy controversial among many Spaniards. With this, it was possible to reduce the infection rate and gradually regain freedom, said the socialist. Without the measures, there would have been 450,000 deaths. 4:03 p.m .: The city of Göttingen started the re-testing of residents of a quarantined building complex on Saturday. As a spokesman for the city said, those who had a negative result in the first major test campaign should be retested for a corona infection in the afternoon. A result is expected early in the week. The city had quarantined around 700 residents of a building complex. Corona infections have been diagnosed in just under 120 people since Thursday. According to the city, more than 200 children and adolescents live in precarious living conditions in the residential complex. It wasn't until May that there was a corona outbreak in the 18-storey Iduna Center just a few hundred meters away, because according to the city council members of several families had violated the hygiene and clearance rules at private celebrations. 2:48 p.m .: Because of the corona pandemic, day tourism was not permitted on the East Frisian Islands for many weeks. As of next week, this will change: Even short vacationers can then visit the islands again - with various restrictions. Because there is currently no uniform regulation for day tourists. From Monday, Juist and Baltrum will open their doors to day guests. Borkum, Spiekeroog, Langeoog and Wangerooge will follow on Tuesday. However, Norderney can still only be visited if you spend at least one night there. However, as the NDR reports, day vacationers cannot visit Wangerooge on weekends and at the start of the holiday. And from Tuesday, Langeoog will initially only allow 200 day visitors to the island, none at weekends. 2:03 p.m .: The Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlüt Cavusoglu was disappointed by the Federal Government's classification of Turkey as a corona risk area and by the ongoing travel warning. There is \"no objective and scientific reason for this,\" said Cavusoglu on Saturday at a joint press conference with Tourism Minister Mehmet Nuri Ersoy in the resort of Antalya. \"Of course we are disappointed, but I don't think that will affect our bilateral relations,\" said Cavusoglu. He wanted to keep in dialogue with Germany and convince the federal government to change its position. It is not a confrontation. The Turkish ambassador in Berlin had already criticized his country's classification as a corona risk area on Wednesday. For more than 160 countries outside the EU - including Turkey - there is still a travel warning until August 31. The federal government, along with 130 other countries, also classified Turkey as a corona risk area on Monday. People who enter Germany from a risk area must expect a 14-day quarantine. 13:36: Around 60 people met on Saturday afternoon in front of the Tönnies slaughterhouse in Rheda-Wiedenbrück to protest against the company. \"We are here, we are loud because you steal the rights of the people,\" cried a voice choir. Numerous people held up posters that said, \"Stop the Tönnies system\" and \"Animals are not a commodity\". Some protesters had painted themselves with fake blood. A local police spokesman said in the early afternoon that the demonstration had so far been peaceful. Protest in front of the Tönnies premises The protest was organized by several environmental and animal protection organizations, including Fridays for Future. \"We see ourselves as a justice movement,\" said Stefan Schneidt from Fridays For Future Gütersloh. Tönnies clearly violates labor law and animal welfare. Four days ago, it was announced that an outbreak had occurred among the employees of the largest German slaughterhouse with a large number of corona infected people. 13:33: The number of proven corona infections in Europe has exceeded the threshold of 2.5 million. As of Saturday morning, 2,500,091 cases were diagnosed, according to AFP news agency official agency census. More than 192,000 people in Europe died from the effects of an infection. This makes Europe the continent most affected by the pandemic, even if the virus is currently the fastest spreading in Latin America. The most affected country in Europe is Russia with more than 570,000 infections, followed by Great Britain (302,000), Spain (246,000) and Italy (238,000). 12.49 p.m .: In the Australian state of Victoria, some loosening is being withdrawn due to increasing numbers of infections. As of Monday, only meetings of up to ten people are allowed in public. Only five people are allowed to come together at home. Previously, the limit for meetings in public and at home was 20 people. Twenty-five new Covid-19 cases were reported in Victoria on Saturday, including some related to family reunions. 12.21 p.m .: After the Corona outbreak at Tönnies, the SPD health politician Karl Lauterbach demanded that the meat factory in Rheda-Wiedenbrück be closed immediately. Lauterbach said on Saturday on WDR television that he considered it \"unacceptable\" that the factory was still working at all. The source of the infections has not yet been discovered. \"We don't know, did that happen in the canteen, on the way there, in the processing itself, is it the ventilation? That means people could continue to become infected now. I would shut down the business in these circumstances.\" He knew that the meat would then no longer be processed. \"Then that's how it is.\" The district of Gütersloh had announced on Friday that after the slaughterhouse and other parts of the plant had been closed, the cutting plants and dispatch should not be closed until Saturday evening. The district had given the company a so-called work quarantine in the production areas in order to be able to process the last slaughtered animals into food. 12.10 p.m .: The Bundeswehr has expanded its operations at the Tönnies slaughterhouse in Rheda-Wiedenbück. \"We have brought in 40 more soldiers,\" said Bundeswehr spokesman Uwe Kort on Saturday. \"20 of them help with documentation and 20 help with contact person tracking.\" The forces are on the road with ten Bundeswehr vehicles and, together with medical staff and employees from the Gütersloh district, will be driving down accommodations and testing people there. According to Kort, the soldiers speak Eastern European languages ​​in order to be able to communicate with the workers. A total of 25 soldiers had already arrived in Rheda-Wiedenbrück on Friday. Spokesman Uwe Kort does not rule out that additional soldiers could be requested. The district of Gütersloh had previously asked the Bundeswehr for help with a series test for corona infections at the slaughterhouse. It was announced on Wednesday that an outbreak with a large number of people infected with corona had occurred among the employees of the largest German slaughterhouse in Tönnies near Rheda-Wiedenbrück. 11:57: Parents are desperate, students are annoyed, teachers are resigned - and Germany's prime ministers want the schools to soon be back to normal. But this is an illusion for several reasons. The SPIEGEL cover story. 11:24: Because of the entrance exams for high schools, the Turkish authorities imposed a six-hour curfew on 81 cities on Saturday. It is valid until 3 p.m. local time and is intended to guarantee that there are no traffic jams in front of the schools and test centers. On June 27th and 28th, there will be further curfews due to university entrance exams, according to the Anadolu news agency. Health Minister Fahrettin Koca said that the exception to the ban on going out is accompanying students and travelers who have already purchased a ticket. In addition, supermarkets and bakeries remained open. 11:13: Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has called on all citizens to use the new Corona app voluntarily. The application is \"an important helper when it comes to detecting and interrupting chains of infection,\" she said in her weekly video message. \"The more you participate, the greater the benefit.\" The corona warning app imago images / Friedrich Stark Merkel campaigned in the video published on Saturday for trust in the data protection of the app. You secure privacy by consistently encrypting generated data. Geodata would not be collected, data would not be stored centrally. The app is also completely voluntary. \"There is no reward for using it and no disadvantage if someone chooses not to.\" 11:04: IG Metall sees \"hundreds of thousands of jobs\" threatened by the consequences of the corona pandemic and calls for immediate countermeasures by politicians. Due to bankruptcies alone, \"150,000 jobs are threatened unless economic impulses are quickly set,\" said union chief Jörg Hofmann of the \"Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung\". \"The metal and electrical industry and steel are still in a downward spiral. In industries such as mechanical engineering and plant engineering, the slump in orders is only now starting to take hold, and over 20 percent of companies only started short-time work in May or June,\" said Hofmann. In the metal and electrical industry alone, more than two million people are on short-time work. According to a nationwide company survey conducted by IG Metall, seven out of ten companies have short-time work, according to the \"WAZ\". Hofmann criticized that only around a quarter of the Federal Government's aid program, which is worth EUR 130 billion, is aimed at reviving the economy in the short term. What is also open is the benefit of reducing VAT. 10:33 a.m .: Complaints from consumers about airlines and Deutsche Bahn have increased significantly in the Corona period: Currently, the arbitration board for public passenger transport (SÖP) receives two to three times as many requests for arbitration each week as in the comparable periods of previous years, said SÖP managing director Heinz Klewe the \"Handelsblatt\". The number of applications has more than doubled in the first two weeks of June: from 810 to around 1900. Most complaints concern airlines. \"Customers of the airlines want to finally be reimbursed the ticket costs for flights that have not taken place,\" said Klewe. \"Rail customers, on the other hand, are annoyed that they will receive a voucher that is valid until the end of October and is only valid for the route they have booked, for saver price and super saver price tickets bought after 4 May that cannot be used.\" 10.18 a.m .: Within 24 hours, the health authorities in Germany have reported 601 new infections with the corona virus to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). The day before, the number of 770 cases was noticeably higher than the previous day. Since the start of the corona crisis, 189,135 people in Germany have been shown to have contracted Sars-CoV-2, as the RKI reported on Saturday morning (data as of June 20, midnight). The increase in the number of cases is due in particular to larger outbreaks in North Rhine-Westphalia, Hesse and Berlin, the RKI said. 8883 people who have been proven to be infected with the virus have so far died in Germany - an increase of 11 compared to the previous day. RKI estimates that around 174,400 people have survived the infection. 9:50 am: Almost 40 percent of people in Germany stated that they gained weight during the lockdown. How can that be? Nutrition expert Thomas Ellrott explains why many people got fatter during the corona crisis, how the subconscious controls eating behavior and what can be done about it. 9:38 am: The US cruise industry, battered by the corona crisis, is still suffering. The providers had agreed to voluntarily extend their pandemic-related break and to suspend operations from US ports until September 15, the industry association CLIA said on Friday (local time). All major providers are represented in the organization. The decision was made because of the \"persistent situation related to Covid-19 within the United States\". The US health agency CDC's ban on cruise ships is currently set to expire on July 24, and some providers had actually had plans for a slow restart from August. But it is increasingly clear that more time is needed, it was said. 9:32 am: Guatemala's President Alejandro Giammattei replaced the Minister of Health in the midst of the corona crisis. Giammattei said on Friday that he had sworn in María Flores and three vice ministers. Flores, who had held a senior position in the Ministry of Health during the government of President Óscar Berger (2004-2008), replaces the previous minister Hugo Monroy. The conservative Giammattei, himself a trained doctor, did not give a reason. The Guatemalan prosecutor for human rights, Jordan Rodas, called the move important, but belated. In an open letter on March 23, he had already recommended Giammattei to dismiss Monroy. Checks in hospitals and the purchase of materials had revealed deeply worrying shortcomings in the way the Ministry of Health dealt with the corona crisis, it was said at the time. 09:18: Car and vacation will be the big winners of the corona crisis, according to Hamburg futurologist Horst Opaschowski. He expects a wave of travel on German roads and highways. \"An explosion in auto tourism is on the horizon,\" Opaschowski told the German Press Agency. Vacationing with your own vehicle is becoming a new normal because air travel and cruises are less possible and desirable. In addition, distance rules and the obligation to wear a mask threaten to become an \"atmosphere killer\" in flight, cruise and sometimes also in rail tourism. In his prediction, Opaschowski also relied on a representative survey in which 73 percent of those surveyed said in March that they would continue to move around on vacation as before and that nothing would change about their travel behavior. The Opaschowski Institute for Future Research (O.I.Z) determined that the joy of traveling, especially among large cities and people in metropolitan areas, is unbroken (76 percent). 9:01 am: In North American professional sports, several clubs have reacted to Corona cases by closing their training facilities. The Philadelphia Phillies from the MLB baseball professional league closed their facility on Friday indefinitely. According to media reports, the Toronto Blue Jays from the MLB and Tampa Bay Lightning from the ice hockey professional league NHL also initially prohibit access to the training facilities. At Philadelphia, five players and three employees tested positive. The test results of 32 other people from the club environment are still pending, the club said. The Tampa Bay Times and ESPN reported that Lightning closed the facilities at least until July 6 after several positive cases. The Blue Jays are said to have ended their training camp in Dunedin after a player showed symptoms. 08.35: Saudi Arabia wants to reopen the mosques in the holy city of Mecca, which have been closed for three months because of the corona crisis, on Sunday. The state television reported, citing a decision by the Ministry of Islamic Affairs. Around 1,500 holy sites were preparing to receive visitors. TV pictures showed how workers disinfect the floors and carpets in mosques. The decision to reopen the mosques is made a few weeks before the Hajj, the annual Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca. It is unclear whether the event planned for the end of July will take place due to the corona pandemic. So far, Mecca has had a strict curfew. Outside the holy city, mosques were reopened at the end of May, albeit under strict rules of distance. 08:23: France wants to reopen its stadiums for spectators from July 11th: A maximum of 5000 people will then be able to sit in the stands, the French government said on Friday. As of Monday, cinemas and casinos in the country may reopen. The improvement in the situation in the Corona pandemic would allow \"certain bans to be lifted, provided that everyone remains vigilant,\" the statement said. The number of 5,000 spectators in stadiums and on racetracks can be adjusted in mid-August if the situation improves further. The government also announced the prospect of reopening clubs, fairs and exhibitions from September. 8:16 am: As the seventh country in the world, Mexico has passed the 20,000 death toll due to the corona crisis. According to the government on Friday (local time), the number of registered fatalities after Covid 19 disease increased by 647 compared to the previous day to 20,394. Accordingly, more than 170,000 infections with the corona virus have been detected. Mexico has the second most fatalities within Latin America and the fourth most infections after Brazil, Peru and Chile. However, very few people are tested there for the Sars-CoV-2 pathogen. 8:09 am: Luxembourg wants to prevent a second wave of corona with comprehensive tests of the entire population. For this purpose, the residents and employees were divided into small groups, whose members are tested alternately and regularly: \"If there are new infections, we know exactly where it happens and can break chains,\" said the director of the Luxembourg Health Institute, Ulf Nehrbass, the German press agency. Up to 20.00 tests per day are currently possible at 17 test stations. Luxembourg was the first European country to offer such extensive testing on Covid-19, said Nehrbass. Ten percent of the 600,000 plus 300,000 cross-border commuters have already been \"tested\". Around 30 million euros are available for the voluntary tests from the beginning of May to the end of July. \"It would be good if the tests continued afterwards,\" said Nehrbass, who is also the spokesman for the Covid-19 task force in Luxembourg. The second wave is expected in autumn. \"And we should be ready there.\" So far, the number of people tested on Covid-19 in Luxembourg has been around 4,100. 110 people have died from the virus. 8:03 a.m .: After the new coronavirus outbreak in Beijing, the number of infected people has continued to increase: As the state health commission announced on Saturday, 21 further infections were detected in the capital. A total of 27 infected people were reported across the country. Beijing now plans to test all food delivery and other delivery service employees for the corona virus in the coming days, the state-run Beijing News reports. After the tests had initially concentrated on the districts around the market where the virus had occurred, tens of thousands of delivery service employees who were traveling around the city every day were now to be tested. 8:00 a.m .: In Brazil, the number of corona infections has exceeded the one million mark. The total number of infections rose to 1,032,913 on Friday, said the Ministry of Health. Almost 49,000 people died as a result of Covid 19 disease. That is the highest number after the United States. The authorities also reported the highest number of new infections within a day. According to this, 54,771 other people were infected with the virus. The jump was due to the fact that some states reported numbers from several days at a time, the ministry said.\n",

            " A heat wave has been plaguing Siberia for months. In May, surface temperatures in parts of the huge Russian region were up to 10 degrees above average, according to the EU Copernicus Climate Service. Even unprecedented temperatures were measured at the Arctic Circle: In Chatanga, for which daytime temperatures are normal at zero degrees at this time of year, on 25 May it was an exceptional 25 degrees. The previous record was 12 degrees. The extreme weather alarms climate scientists. According to the British newspaper \"The Guardian\", the high temperatures have caused large forest fires and a plague of tree-eating moths, which in turn exacerbate the heat. Martin Stendel of the Danish Meteorological Institute told the newspaper that the temperatures measured in May in northwestern Siberia are only normal once every 100,000 years, but man-made warming increases the likelihood of such extreme weather events significantly. Siberia is one of the regions in the world for which climate change is expected to result in relatively strong warming and significant temperature fluctuations. The temperatures around the poles rise fastest because the ocean currents transport heat there and reflective ice and snow melt away. \"Although the planet as a whole warms up, this does not happen evenly,\" said researcher Freja Vamborg from the Copernicus climate service to the \"Guardian\". \"Therefore, large temperature anomalies in Siberia are not surprising to a certain extent. What is unusual, however, is how long the above-average heating anomalies have existed.\" Field fire in southern Siberia in April: out of control due to strong winds. Last winter in Siberia is said to have been the hottest since records began 130 years ago. In the spring, many fires that farmers used to clear their fields got out of control due to strong winds and became hundreds of thousands of hectares of forest fires. In addition, the swarms of the Siberian silkworm, whose larvae feed on conifers, grew rapidly with the rising temperatures. Without needles, however, the trees are more prone to fire, warn moth researchers. The above-average warming in Siberia is also largely responsible for the oil disaster in Norilsk. According to the operator, a tank in the thermal power station there should have collapsed at the end of May due to the thawing permafrost soil. 20,000 tons of diesel leaked and contaminated the surrounding waters. Experts such as the permafrost researcher Guido Grosse from the Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI) in Potsdam believe that the influence of thawing soils is plausible, but also refer to the old age and the design of the tank.\n",

            " The search for 1.9 billion euros in the balance sheet of the payment service provider Wirecard has so far been unsuccessful: The management board of the Dax group announced on Monday night that the bank balances \"with a high probability do not exist\". The controversial CEO Markus Braun resigned on Friday after auditors had noticed on Thursday that a billion euros were missing from the company's balance sheet. This was followed by a historic drop in Wirecard shares by more than 80 percent. But what does the Aschheim group near Munich do anyway? And how is the scandal related to its business model? The answers to the most important questions. Wirecard is largely unknown to the general public because consumers only come into contact with the company indirectly. Regardless of whether customers buy books online or book travel: Wirecard is often the central intermediary between buyers, sellers and their banks in the background. Specifically, this means that if a customer pays by credit card, the money from Visa or Mastercard does not flow directly to the retailer, but goes first to Wirecard. The company only forwards the money to the retailer with a delay. Wirecard collects commissions because the company bears the risk and guarantees that the money will be booked to the recipient. The margins for such deals are small, but the bulk makes it. Wirecard needs the money for its services in Asia. Wirecard also switches between end customers and retailers there. If the customer leaves a store after buying a card, for example, he has goods, but the retailer does not yet have his money. Wirecard advances the amount to the retailer. The 1.9 billion euros thus serve as collateral for loans granted to traders. A representative of the Wirecard Group is said to have filled several accounts for the German company at two Philippine banks. Should a customer payment fail, Wirecard can use these accounts. If this does not happen, the money will remain in the escrow account as security. If everything goes well, Wirecard can also operate profitably without ever having to access the 1.9 billion euros. Wirecard's business practices in Asia are also fundamentally criticized. Because in Asia, the company does not have its own license as a payment service provider. That is why the Group needs so-called third-party partners in the Far East who maintain contact with local dealers. This business is called Third Party Acquiring (TPA). According to Wirecard, it therefore did not transfer the money to the two institutes itself. The Financial Times previously reported that parts of these bookings did not exist. As a result, auditors commissioned by KMPG were unable to provide any information on the amount and existence of sales from the third-party business. Neither that they exist and are correct, nor that they do not exist and are not correct. Filipino Wirecard trustee Mark Tolentino, who is said to have managed the 1.9 billion euros, has nothing to do with possible unfair transactions by Wirecard. In a statement available to SPIEGEL, his lawyer Dennis Manalo \"relentlessly\" assures that Tolentino's law firm MKT Law has no knowledge of \"alleged irregularities\", according to which evidence of bank balances at two Philippine banks could be forged. Wirecard is threatened massively because the company could be terminated loans in the billions. Because of the incident, the company is unable to provide a verified balance sheet. This could force banks to request loans back. Investors are currently selling off Wirecard shares in bulk. The company's papers fell another 44 percent on Monday and at 12.99 euros were at times as cheap as they were eight years ago. On Wednesday evening, a Wirecard share was still worth over 100 euros. A price drop that is unprecedented in German stock market history. All medium-sized and large corporations are required by law to have the annual financial statements audited by an auditor. EY has reviewed Wirecard's financial statements for years, so far without complaining. Checking bank balances is one of the basic tasks. It is about auditors getting a bank to ensure that the booked credit is actually available. As part of this review, EY's auditors have now found that the bank records of the Filipino accounts were forged. The Tübingen law firm TILP therefore sees no mistakes by the auditors and refrains from complaining against the company. \"As far as we understand, EY has not covered itself with fame here. From a capital market perspective, Wirecard is still the central responsibility. And that is of crucial importance. Wirecard has the best chance of obtaining damages, if only because it is legally easier to enforce \"says Maximilian Weiss, lawyer of the TILP group. State regulators now have to decide whether EY is guilty because the company did not inquire earlier. \"Thorough audits should have uncovered such damage earlier,\" says Green finance politician Danyal Bayaz. The public prosecutor could apply for an arrest warrant against longtime managers Markus Braun and Jan Marsalek if the two had committed a criminal offense in the wake of the accounting scandal. Counterfeiting of accounts and fraud by banks would be possible criminal offenses. \"We are investigating all possible offenses,\" said a spokeswoman for the Munich I public prosecutor's office on Monday. Braun and Marsalek have always rejected all allegations during their time at Wirecard. The company sees itself as the victim of a billion dollar scam.\n",

Don't miss anything: Subscribe to our Coronavirus newsletter for the latest developments and key background information. 02.30 a.m .: In the case of regional corona outbreaks, North Rhine-Westphalia's school minister Yvonne Gebauer should not always \"reflexively\" close the schools. If there were regional infections, one had to react \"selectively\", the FDP politician told the \"Kölner Stadt-Anzeiger\" (Friday). \"However, it cannot be the case that local decision-makers always reflexively close daycare centers and schools as the first and only measure\" if there are corona cases in the vicinity of schools, said Gebauer. \"I would like a differentiated view - and no actionism at the expense of our children.\" Due to the corona outbreak at the meat producer Tönnies, the schools in the Warendorf district have been closed since Thursday. In the neighboring district of Gütersloh they have been closed for a few days. 02:00: From Saturday, the Danes are allowed to travel to most European countries again, as the government in Copenhagen announced on Thursday. The prerequisite for lifting the travel warning is above all that the number of new infections in the respective country is less than 20 per 100,000 inhabitants. The Danes are still advised against traveling to Great Britain, Ireland, Malta, Portugal, Romania and almost all regions of Sweden. On June 15, Denmark had already opened its borders again to Germans, Norwegians and Icelanders. The renewed easing shows that the situation in large parts of Europe is better than recently thought, Foreign Minister Jeppe Kofod said. Norway wants to further relax its travel restrictions, which are currently the strictest in Europe, on July 15, as Prime Minister Erna Solberg announced. The country, which is not a member of the EU but belongs to the Schengen area, has currently closed its borders for most foreigners without residence in Norway. Foreign travel is not officially prohibited for the Norwegians themselves, but a ten-day quarantine is required on return. The quarantine regulation is now to be lifted. The prerequisite is that certain criteria are met in every country, said Solberg. A corresponding country list should be published on July 10 and updated regularly. Norway opened its borders for its neighbors Denmark, Finland and Iceland on June 15, but not for Sweden. Norway has reported 8793 corona infections and 249 deaths so far, Denmark 12,836 cases and 603 deaths. 1.30 a.m .: Mexico's Finance Minister Arturo Herrera announced on Thursday that he had tested positive for the corona virus. He has only mild symptoms and will now work from home, Herrera wrote on Twitter. It is currently unclear how closely he was in contact with President Andres Manuel López Obrador recently. Mexico currently has 196,847 cases, according to Johns Hopkins University, and over 24,300 people have already died from the virus. 1:00 a.m .: The number of new corona infections in the USA continues to climb and is at its highest level in weeks. Recently, there were 37,667 new cases, bringing the total to around 2.374 million, the CDC said. On Wednesday there were 34,313 and on Tuesday 26,643. The number of deaths now increases by 692 to 121,809. In comparison, the daily value on June 1 was around 17,400 new infections. The United States is the world's most affected by the pandemic in terms of the number of people infected. 12:47: The bank stress test turned out to be positive, but the US Federal Reserve wants the financial institutions to hold their money together in the face of the corona crisis - and initially prohibits share buybacks and dividend increases. Read more here. 00:20: The city of Göttingen is canceling the corona-related quarantine for an entire residential complex this Thursday at midnight. The city announced on Wednesday evening. The primary goal of the quarantine was to limit the outbreak of infection locally, to protect the entire population and also to prevent it from spreading beyond the urban area. The measures ordered had had an effect, said Petra Broistedt, Social Affairs Director and head of the staff for extraordinary events in the city of Göttingen. For this reason, the building quarantine can be lifted as planned. However, individual quarantines, such as those of infected people or first-degree contact persons, remain. A total of 600 secondary tests were carried out, according to the information. Only four other people had a positive test result. These are contact persons for infected people in a family environment. From Friday until June 30th (Tuesday), controls will be carried out at the entrance and exit of the complex to ensure that individual residents with a quarantine obligation do not leave the building. The roughly 700 residents were not allowed to leave the building complex, or were only allowed to leave after some 120 of them had tested positive. Lower Saxony's Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) praised the city's crisis management. \"The authorities are very attentive and very committed, they go into problematic situations very early on and are very consistent. They are currently able to encapsulate the infections,\" he said during a visit to Göttingen. 12:10 AM: As the number of infections rises rapidly, the US state of Texas puts further easing of the coronavirus restrictions on hold. Governor Greg Abbott said Thursday that further phases of the reopening will be suspended for now. However, previous loosening would not be reversed. \"As we see an increase in Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations, we are focusing on strategies to slow the spread of the virus while allowing Texans to make money for their families,\" said the Republican Party politician, President Donald Trump. \"Closing business is the last thing we want as a state.\" The current pause in corona loosening will help curb the spread of the virus, Abbott said. The governor called on the population to wear protective masks, to wash their hands regularly and to observe distance rules. Texas and a number of other US states are currently experiencing the highest number of new coronavirus infections since the crisis began.\n",

            " For the first time, the European Medicines Agency has given the green light for a drug against Covid-19. The EMA recommends approval of remdesivir for the treatment of Covid-19 patients. The drug should receive conditional market approval for Europe, the authority said on Thursday in The Hague. The European Commission still has to approve the approval, but this is a matter of form. The EMA recommendation applies to the treatment of adults and adolescents from the age of 12. A prerequisite for treatment is that the patient has pneumonia and must be supplied with additional oxygen. Remdesivir was actually developed by the US manufacturer Gilead for the treatment of Ebola. The drug has already received exemptions in the United States and Japan for the treatment of infections with the novel corona virus. At the beginning of June, the EMA announced that it wanted to accelerate the approval of remdesivir for the treatment of Covid-19 in Europe (read an analysis here). An international study with over 1,000 participants showed at the end of April that remdesivir in Covid 19 patients could reduce the time to recovery by an average of four days - from 15 to 11 days. Mortality decreased slightly in the study, but was not statistically significant. Europe is the continent most affected by the corona pandemic. Almost 200,000 people on the continent died.\n",

            " The Australian sweets \"Red Skins\" and \"Chicos\" are to be given new names against the backdrop of the global racism debate. The manufacturer Nestlé announced this Tuesday. The names had an \"undertone\" that was not in line with the values ​​of the group. However, the new names have not yet been finalized. By taking this step, Nestlé claims to ensure that \"friends, neighbors and colleagues\" are not \"marginalized\". The pack of \"chicos\" showed a dark-skinned baby until a few years ago. On the packaging of the \"Red Skins\" there was still a picture of a Native American with traditional headdresses. The logo with feather headdress continues to be emblazoned on the jerseys, pennants and caps of the Washington Redskins football team: For years, many indigenous Americans have been insulted by the team name of the capital club. Large sections of the population consider it racist, and numerous media no longer use it. In the wake of the global anti-racism protests sparked by the murder of African American George Floyd, activists recently called for a new name. For years they have been fighting for the Redskins to rename themselves. Even Barack Obama joined the discussion in 2013. \"If I were the owner of the team and I knew the name of the team, even if it had a long history, would offend a significant amount of people, I would consider changing the name,\" said the then president. Democratic governor Jerry Brown banned the use of the term redskins in California in 2015. Since January 2017, according to the California Racial Mascots Act, teams or mascots can no longer be called this for ethical reasons. With the law, California was the first state to ban the term.\n",

            " Prenell Rousseau is said to have visited singer Billie Eilish's house a total of seven times before he was arrested for trespassing. Now a court has issued a permanent injunction against the man. He is forbidden to approach or try to contact the artist or her parents for at least three years. According to the judge, the order can be extended if necessary. Eilish's lawyer had requested a five-year term. The court found three years to be sufficient, since the defendant has recently made no attempts to contact her. On May 4 and 5, the 24-year-old rang the doorbell of the apartment building in Los Angeles several times and inquired whether the singer lived there. Repeated attempts to send him away failed, according to the plaintiffs. They then alerted a private security service. While the family was waiting for this, the intruder would have sat on the porch, read a book, and periodically monologated to himself, Billie Eilish said, according to court documents. Rousseau did not respond to her father's requests to leave the house. As the Internet portal TMZ reported, Rousseau also did not wear a face mask, which had additionally unsettled the family in view of the prevailing corona risk.\n",

            " Hardly anything can be seen on the test photos by the US researchers: the hair color can just be guessed at, perhaps the beard and the glasses. But are the eyes open or closed? Was the forehead wrinkled or smooth? Such details are not visible, but the resolution of 16 by 16 pixels is far too low. Nevertheless, at the end of the experiment something clearly recognizable. Just what, or better: who? The researchers have developed a process that turns pixel porridge into razor-sharp faces. Using artificial intelligence (AI), the software called Pulse is able to extrapolate a 16 by 16 pixel image to a resolution of up to 1024 by 1024 pixels. The process produces such sharp photos that even stubble, wrinkles and strands of hair can be seen in places where previously only chunky pixels were visible. \"Never before has image enhancement been able to take photos with such a high resolution and with so many details,\" said a scientist from the Pulse team to the university magazine at Duke University in North Carolina. So far, it has only been possible to calculate pixelated images eight times sharper. With Pulse, it is possible to display the photos up to 64 times higher, according to the report (PDF). A new process should make this possible. In most previous models, neural networks speculate on the basis of training data based on numerous facial photos which pixels could be seen on the original image. The scientists at Duke University take a different approach: First, they create fictitious portrait pictures from the pixel porridge. An AI invents these people and uses the StyleGAN library, among other things, to shape faces according to criteria such as age, gender and skin color. Then, in turn, these artificially created photos are small. The photo that most closely resembles the original blurry photo after shrinking is taken. But there is a problem. Florian Gallwitz from the Technical University of Nuremberg said in an interview with SPIEGEL: \"The researchers are not looking for the original.\" He did not want the model to extrapolate a picture of his grandmother, because the high-resolution photo might show a completely different person. The technology only makes sense if the identity of the person is not important. He therefore considers the procedure unsuitable for criminal prosecution. \"You cannot use this software to turn a blurred picture of a bank robber into a clear mug shot,\" says Gallwitz. However, he could imagine an experiment in which witnesses of a bank robbery are shown several artificially generated phantom images of the perpetrator and thus simulate a comparison with witnesses. \"Perhaps this would be a better way to search for perpetrators than with a blurred image from a surveillance camera.\" The Pulse scientists themselves make it clear that it is currently not possible with their method to make an indistinct person recognizable on a surveillance recording. But then the question arises as to what the technology is suitable for. The researchers write that their model is not limited to faces and can also be used in other areas such as medicine. Gallwitz doubts that. \"At the moment I can't really imagine where this could be useful in medicine, but maybe I just lack the imagination for it.\" According to Gallwitz, one possible application is the image improvement of a stadium photo with low resolution, which should be pulled up to poster size. The faces of the viewers would then be clearly recognizable on the result image. Then the viewer must not care that the pictured fans look different from those who actually sat in the stadium.\n",

            " A raid squad blocked a car in Düsseldorf and stabbed the inmates. Two 26 and 39 year old men were seriously injured by multiple stab wounds, a police spokesman said. The homicide commission assumes that the attackers wanted to kill their victims. The act happened late Wednesday evening. At first, a traffic accident was reported to the police. It later turned out that the seriously injured driver of the wedged car had tried to escape the attackers on foot. His car rolled off and collided with parked vehicles. According to witnesses, a car is said to have blocked the way in which three men aged 26, 39 and 52 were seated. A third vehicle then blocked the way back from behind. As a result, several unknown persons jumped out of it, tore open the doors of the wedged-in car and stabbed. Then they reportedly hurried back to their cars and drove away. According to the police, the victims said they had not recognized the perpetrators and did not know why they had been attacked. \"At the moment we are in the dark, we don't have a hot trail yet,\" said a spokesman for the prosecutor. No previously known witness to the event had remembered the license plates of the perpetrators' cars.\n",

            " The salary for the new job sounds good. But how much money is left of it? Which tax bracket is the cheapest if both spouses work? And how does a child allowance affect? All of these questions can be answered with the gross-net calculator. Simply enter your gross wages and allowances, choose tax class, state and health insurance. If you have children, please indicate possible child allowances. The more information you provide, the more accurate the result. To be able to use the calculator, you must first know your income tax class. Here is a brief overview of which class you belong to. Income tax class I applies to the following employees: -Ledige-widowed persons from the year after next after the death of the spouse or registered partner, divorced-married or living in a partnership who are permanently separated-married or living in partnership, their spouse or registered partner is subject to limited taxation in the Federal Republic (usually because he or she does not live in Germany) Wage tax class II applies to single parents who meet the requirements of tax class I and who are also entitled to the relief amount for single parents. Wage tax class III includes the following employees: -Married and registered life partners who do not permanently live separately and have not chosen tax class IV. The spouse or life partner who is also employed then receives tax class V. If the other partner is not employed or self-employed, he is also subject to income tax class III widowed until the end of the calendar year following the death of the spouse / life partner. The deceased spouse or life partner must have been subject to unlimited income tax at the time of his death. The spouses or life partners must not have lived separately until the time of death. Married employees or those living in partnership fall into income tax class IV if both partners are subject to unlimited income tax and do not permanently live separately. However, if one partner is in tax class III, the other does not fall in tax class IV, but in tax class V. Spouses or life partners who are both employed can have the tax class changed once a year. Salary negotiations: Seven golden rules Tax class V is applied when both spouses or life partners apply to classify the other spouse or life partner in tax class III (see above). Income tax class VI is usually entered if an employee has more than one employment relationship . How do your finances change when you change your life? With the help of this calculator you can quickly and easily find out, for example, how a job change or a salary increase will affect your net salary. This way you can avoid surprises when you actually have the first new pay slip in your hands. Other changes in life can also be tapped for their financial impact with the help of the calculator. They want to marry? Then you and your partner have to think about which tax classes you want to work in: either one in III or the other in V or both in IV. Tax class IV is recommended for both partners if both earn similar amounts. Otherwise the combination of III for one partner and V for the other. The tax classes differ only in how much tax is automatically deducted from the salary each month. Those who have paid too much will get the money back once a year after submitting their tax return. Are you expecting a child? Then, as a rule, their net salary increases through child allowances and a higher child benefit. Have you dropped faith? Then you can check whether the saved church tax can make up for the waiver of eternal salvation. Are you considering switching from statutory to private health insurance? If you know what contribution rate your new insurance will charge, you can use the calculator to check how this will change your net salary. However, you should never make the question of the right health insurance dependent solely on tax considerations. The potential tax savings are small compared to the huge costs that poorly chosen private health insurance entails over the years. You can find out which types of insurance generally make sense for you in our overview. The vast majority of tax savings opportunities are only available to those who also submit a tax return. This can be quite a challenge, especially for young workers. You can find help here.\n",

            " After the plane crash in Karachi with 97 deaths, Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) gave a third of its pilots a flight ban. According to the state airline, 150 of its 434 pilots hold dubious licenses, as PIA spokesman Abdullah Hafeez Khan said. Among other things, they are alleged to have been illegally obtained their license by others taking the exams for them. The PIA spokesman said the decision was based on investigating the crash last month. Action will be taken against the pilots - and he promised: \"We will ensure that unqualified pilots never fly airplanes again.\" The country's aviation minister, Ghulam Sarwar Khan, previously said that 262 of the country's 860 pilots had \"fake\" licenses. He announced this when he presented the preliminary investigation report on the crash of the Airbus A320 on May 22nd. A spokesman for the International Air Transport Association IATA spoke of a severe lapsus. \"We are monitoring reports from Pakistan about counterfeit pilot licenses,\" he said. These were a serious shortcoming in licensing and security, but his organization needed more information. The report cited serious mistakes made by pilots and air traffic controllers as the reason for the crash. According to an analysis of the voice recorders, the pilots discussed the entire flight over Corona. The aviation minister said the pilots were concerned and unconcentrated about infected family members. The report excluded a technical defect. On May 22, flight 8303 had crashed into a residential area en route from Lahore shortly before landing in the port city of Karachi. Prior to this, the Airbus landed on the runway during a first landing attempt without landing gear, and the engines were damaged. Only two passengers survived the accident. There is said to have been a landing announcement from the cockpit, but the plane crashed. Airplane and helicopter crashes keep happening in Pakistan. In 2016, more than 40 people died when a PIA machine went up in flames in the north of the country after an engine failure. The most serious plane crash in the country's history to date killed more than 150 people in 2010 when an Airbus A321 from the private airline Airblue crashed into a hilly area during a landing approach to Islamabad. An investigation report at the time also blamed a pilot error for the crash. After a plane from the private airline Bhoja Air crashed in Islamabad in a severe thunderstorm in 2012, killing 127 people, the Pakistani Ministry of Defense announced that it would subject all of the country's private airlines to a technical inspection.\n",

            " The mystery surrounding the missing billions of the Dax group Wirecard is getting more and more mysterious, and the man who could solve it takes cover: Mark Tolentino, lawyer with a law firm in the Philippine financial center Makati City, is the trustee of the 1, according to SPIEGEL information 9 billion euros to which Wirecard is allegedly entitled and which the auditor EY has so far been unsuccessful in seeking. The money corresponds to around a quarter of the total assets of the Aschheim payment service provider. Because it is missing, EY (formerly Ernst & Young) refuses the seal of approval for the Wirecard balance sheet of 2019. And that in turn plunged the group, which actually wanted to present its balance sheet on Thursday, into the existential crisis. The share price collapsed, CEO Markus Braun resigned, his intimate Jan Marsalek shot. Whether the company has a future depends on the benevolence of its lending banks, which are currently negotiating under high pressure whether to extend the credit line for Wirecard that expires at the end of June. Otherwise, the lights could go out for the company - a case of historic proportions in economic history. As a trustee, Tolentino would play a key role in solving the bizarre, allegedly criminal circumstances; At least in Wirecard circles it is said that the man has exactly this function. He is currently not available by phone or email. On his law firm's website, Tolentino is described as \"young, dynamic and aggressive\". He is available to his clients as an experienced mediator, especially as an expert in family law. In addition, he is generally familiar with business (\"business\"), immigration laws and cryptocurrencies. A colorful bouquet of legal competences, which he conveys to legal seekers in person, but also various radio programs; the corresponding transmission frequencies are included in the network. According to Wirecard circles, this Tolentino is said to have managed the trust money for Wirecard that the group needs for its Asian business, currently around 1.9 billion euros. In this context, business means: Wirecard switches between the end customer, who buys a pair of sneakers, for example, and the retailer who sells the sneakers. If the customer leaves the store after the purchase, he has new shoes, but the dealer does not yet have his money. Wirecard advances the amount to the dealer; the company's risk assessment is also done by the company, which is making so many headlines. A lot of cash is needed for this service. Since Wirecard in Asia, unlike in Europe, does not hold any licenses to do business, the group needs so-called third parties in the Far East who pay it commissions for payment processing. This business is called Third Party Acquiring (TPA). Tolentino has been a trustee for Wirecard since 2019, after the predecessor had given up his mandate due to the many inconsistencies surrounding the company. In this order, he is said to have deposited 1.9 billion euros with the Philippine big banks BDO Unibank and Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI). However, the institutes say they have no knowledge of the money. \"Wirecard is not one of our customers,\" they said. Documents submitted by external Wirecard auditors were forged; Papers that were supposed to confirm a Wirecard account bear false signatures from bank representatives. The central bank of the Philippines is also at a loss. In the Wirecard environment, the reason why the trustee was not forced to park the money at a major international bank such as the Sino-British HSBC is that Asian traders wanted to see the money stored at one of the local credit institutions. BDO and BPI are renowned institutes. And managing the money yourself is not possible due to the lack of licenses in Asia. Where the money is, whether it ever existed or is part of a gigantic balance sheet fraud is unclear - Wirecard's critics suspect the latter. The company itself believes that it has been cheated and has filed a complaint against unknown persons. In corporate circles, reference is made to the comments of the two Filipino banks, which practically admitted that they themselves had been cheated. So did bank employees, possibly together with the lawyer Tolentino, put the money aside? Has it just been posted incorrectly and will show up again soon? And have Wirecard employees conspired about a possible coup? Neither of these questions can currently be adequately resolved. The third-party business was already the focus of a special report that the auditing firm KPMG produced at the end of April and that also sent a shock wave through the group. Because Wirecard boss Braun had actually hoped from the report to be able to refute and start again from all allegations that have been going against him and his company for years. Alone, it turned out differently. KPMG did not find any valid evidence for the often suspected balance sheet fraud. But at the same time, the auditors sketched a disastrous picture of the internal control mechanisms and also that the Wirecard management was hardly interested in real information. There was insufficient evidence for payments in trust accounts amounting to one billion euros, for example. Money - even almost two billion euros - is also missing by auditor EY. And because the balance sheet for 2019 should have been available by Friday at the latest, but EY refused the stamp, Wirecard's future is now hanging by a thread. Because without a certified balance sheet, a credit line for a total of two billion euros expires on June 30, which is almost exhausted at 1.75 billion euros - if the banks do not extend the line, Wirecard's fate could be sealed. Institutes such as Commerzbank, ABN Amro and ING belong to the credit consortium, including Deutsche Bank and Austrian banks - Braun and Marsalek come from Vienna. As things stand, you should be able to keep the credit line open, so Wirecard should stay alive for the time being, but at more stringent terms: higher loan interest rates, more security or more specific repayment targets. This would be the usual procedure if banks did not call in loans immediately, even though the loan partner had broken the contract - because like Wirecard, for example, they are unable to produce a certified balance sheet. Because if the money houses immediately push for repayment and the credit partner falls over, the banks may go completely empty-handed. So an extension on tougher terms is often the lesser evil. At least that's how Wirecard calculates. The decision should be made next week. The company has meanwhile got help from investment bank Houlihan Lokey, a specialist in difficult restructuring and insolvency cases, where ex-Bundesbank board member Andreas Dombret will start as a consultant in July. Wirecard itself is said to be trying to get the money back from the two banks in the Philippines if necessary. Their leadership had admitted that they themselves had been duped, which is why the liability lies with the two institutes. Of course, that presupposes that the money ever existed. There are also sources that indicate that Wirecard could survive even if the 1.9 billion euros had disappeared; after all, the group has about € 3.8 billion in equity. But that is a vague calculation. According to the figures for the first nine months of the 2019 financial year - the data for the full year is known to be missing - Wirecard came to EUR 2.3 billion in equity. Only those who add the income from the latest bond issue of over EUR 500 million and the EUR 900 million that investors around the Japanese softbank group have pumped into Wirecard will get around EUR 3.8 billion, but as a convertible bond. Bonds, however, if they are not yet converted into shares, count in the balance sheet as debt and not as equity. In this respect, the equity calculation circulating at Wirecard is wrong. In the internal search for a main culprit for the drama, Aschheim has now arrived at Marsalek, the ex-board member responsible for day-to-day business and liaison with third-party partners in Asia. Ex-CEO Braun, on the other hand, is less to blame; he was \"deeply shocked\" at the scale of the scandal and voluntarily resigned. Braun has come to realize that it has become a burden for the group, it is said. You can, but you don't have to believe that given the circumstances. Braun has been on board at Wirecard for decades and has been a boss for a long time. And, in addition to Marsalek, he's basically the only one who has a full overview of the company and its businesses. It is hard to believe that everything that has now become known should have surprised him. What is certain, on the other hand, is that he, too, should have an interest in the fact that things will soon go up again with Wirecard: with around seven percent of the shares, Braun is one of the largest shareholders in his group. As a result of the share price falling, he lost a fortune, if only on paper so far.\n",

            " A New York policeman has been temporarily arrested and charged after a stranglehold incident in the arrest of an African American. The 39-year-old must answer for, among other things, attempted strangulation, said the district attorney for the borough of Queens, Melinda Katz. After reading the charges, the policeman was released. He had been suspended from work the weekend after videos were released that appear to show that he was illegally strangling a man lying on the floor. The 35-year-old African American was injured and taken to hospital in the Queens District arrest on Sunday. The arrest was made, among other things, on suspicion of disturbance to rest. The city of New York passed a law last week that prohibits and punishes the use of strangleholders. After the death of African-American George Floyd in a brutal police operation in Minneapolis on May 25, mass protests against racism and police brutality had spread across the country. Cities and counties have announced police reforms, such as the abolition of controversial practices such as strangleholds. Floyd had died after a white police officer pressed his knee on the back of his neck for almost nine minutes. Editor's note: In an earlier version of the heading, the police were arrested. In fact, he was arrested. We have changed the position accordingly.\n",

            " In the Gran Sasso underground laboratory in Italy, the most precise measurements are carried out worldwide to detect dark matter. A 163-strong team of researchers has now registered an unusual cluster collision in an experiment. Numerous English-language media took up the news, such as the \"BBC\" and the \"New York Times\". The find attracts attention because the researchers are still puzzling over what the measurement result is all about. The scientists presented the data at a symposium and uploaded it as a PDF for experts. They think three explanations are conceivable: the unusual pattern in the detector data could have been caused by an unprecedented, extremely light particle, an axion. The find would be a sensation. It is also conceivable that the signal was triggered by previously unknown properties of neutrinos, so-called ghost particles. That would turn physical theories upside down. Perhaps the signal is also completely unspectacular and arose from a rare, radioactive substance in the detector fluid. So far, the existence of axions has only been predicted theoretically; they have never been proven. Direct evidence of their existence would confirm decades-old physical theories about matter and the composition of things in the world. To classify the importance of such a find: In 2013, researchers were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for the prediction and detection of another particle, the Higgs boson. \"The discovery of a new particle would be phenomenal,\" Elena Aprile of Columbia University told The New York Times. Aprile has headed the research project since its inception in 2002. Axions emanating from the sun would not be direct evidence of dark matter, but at least an indication that the particle type is more common in the universe. It would then be conceivable that axions originated in the early universe and still influence the gravitation of stars, for example - a property that is attributed to dark matter. For decades, researchers have assumed that, in addition to the known matter, there are unknown particles in the universe that also determine the movement of the stars. The scientists created the unusual patterns in the XENON1T experiment in a trial between 2016 and 2018. They installed a tank with 3.2 tons of pure xenon, a colorless and odorless gas. If a particle hit the test installation, the xenon emitted electrons and generated small flashes of light. However, this always happened without an unusual particle hitting the experimental setup. Because in the 3000 meter high Gran Sasso massif there are small flows of long-known particles. The researchers determined how many hits were to be expected in a certain energy range and came up with 232 events for their experiment. In fact, 285 were registered - 53 more than expected. This is an indication of previously unknown particles, but too little a difference to report their discovery. It is generally difficult to correctly predict the number of hits of super light particles. \"If it turns out that the signal is actually coming from a new particle, it would be a breakthrough that we have been waiting for 40 years to see. The significance of the discovery cannot be overestimated,\" said Adam Falkowski, particle physicist at the university Paris-Saclay in France, the \"Quantamagazine\". Falkowski was not involved in the experiment. He also points out that with discoveries like the current one, the boring answer is often the right one. Researchers complain about the Axion theory, for example, that particularly hot stars would have to cool down over time if they were to continuously remove the particles. However, that is not the case in the form to be expected. The assumption that neutrinos created the pattern cannot be conclusively proven or refuted. Countless of these particles pass unnoticed by our bodies and our environment every second. If they were the cause, they would have to generate a small magnetic field that has so far remained hidden from researchers. Experts would have to think about new physical theories as to how these particles act with their environment and how this fits in with previous observations. \"Despite all the excitement about the data, we have to be patient now,\" quotes the \"Quantamagazine\" the physicist Luca Grandi from the University of Chicago, one of the heads of the experiment. Further trials with a new xenon detector would first have to rule out that the substance tritium is responsible for the signal accumulation.

            " Tritium is a derivative of hydrogen and naturally occurs in small quantities. The substance decays radioactively and could also have been contained in the xenon tank of the experiment. The researchers plan to test whether he created the pattern in the second half of 2020. The \"Sciencemag\", the news website of the scientific journal \"Science\", summarizes the situation as follows: \"The signals are not sufficient to announce the detection of a new particle, but for raised eyebrows.\"\n",

            " Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison informed his countrymen on Friday \"Attacks on Australian organizations by a sophisticated state-based cyber actor\". These are not new, but their frequency is increasing. What he didn't say: who this actor is and what he wants to achieve. So why is Morrison warning the Australians about this cyber-bully, now of all times? Officially, he wants to \"raise awareness\" of the threat. Ultimately, not only would \"all levels of government\" be attacked, but also \"business, political organizations, educational and health institutions, primary care providers and other operators of critical infrastructures\". The fact that there are such attacks shouldn't be new to anyone. The Australian media have been full of it for months. \"It sounded a bit as if Morrison had said 'If you go to the beach you will find sand,'\" said Australia's Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of IT security company CrowdStrike, Michael Sentonas, in an interview with SPIEGEL. But unlike the Prime Minister, Australian companies and institutions are not well prepared for it, \"otherwise we wouldn't see a new big name every week for a successful hacker attack in the news.\" In order to provide specific assistance, Australia's Cyber ​​Security Center (ACSC) published its findings on the techniques and tactics of the undisclosed offenders. In summary, they read: Much of what security researchers have recently discovered and demonstrated in vulnerabilities is being converted into attack tools in a very short time, for example the Citrix security vulnerabilities that became known at the end of 2019. In other words, people who don't patch quickly, i.e. close vulnerabilities, are hacked. In addition, the perpetrators regularly check which networks can basically be reached from the Internet so that new security gaps become known immediately to have suitable targets at hand. If that doesn't work, try different phishing approaches. The goal is always to intercept valid access data and to use it to gain access - presumably because this is less noticeable than placing software in the hijacked network that redirects data. If such tools are installed in the hacked network, they are controlled by servers in Australia that are also hacked. The resulting data traffic is less suspicious than a new connection to another country. In addition, geoblocking is not a suitable protective measure: anyone who blocks access to websites in their own country is hampering themselves in everyday operations. But neither Morrison nor the ACSC say anything about the target of the attacks. The ACSC only writes what is not the goal: \"We have recognized no intention of the actor to carry out any disruptive or destructive activities within the victims' networks.\" So why is it now this step to the public, this great appearance by Morrison with so little information content? Perhaps because a particularly serious attack is currently underway that is not yet publicly known? \"As Morrison did, you wouldn't be telling the opposition leader and regional governments about something like this if there wasn't an active operation,\" said CrowdStrike chief technology officer Sentonas. He expects \"that we will learn more about this in the coming days\". Thomas Reinhold, research assistant at the Chair for Science and Technology for Peace and Security (PEASEC) at the TU Darmstadt and Fellow of Peace Research and Security Policy at the University of Hamburg, considers it possible that both the undisclosed state actor and the Australian government above all wanted to send political messages: the perpetrators had \"exposed themselves to a high risk with the choice of publicly known security gaps and ready-made attack methods available online and had to reckon with the discovery of their activities,\" says Reinhold. In addition, the selection of goals seems \"not very specific\", it is more a question of \"taking what you can find\" with you. That is rather unusual for espionage activities. The question was therefore \"whether the attacks should send a political signal of strength, capacities and opportunities\". Say: Did someone here want to show that they could do great damage to Australia if they wanted to? And did Morrison initially only want to draw a red line, as Reinhold suspects? After all, Australia was a member of the Five Eyes, an alliance with the secret services of the United States, Great Britain, New Zealand and Canada. One could therefore count on support from, among others, the NSA and the British GCHQ, two of the most capable intelligence services in the world. \"In view of the sum of the aggregate capabilities of these organizations in cyberspace, the fact that the Australian government has deliberately not put a finger on a country should be seen as a political warning signal,\" says Reinhold. The elephant in cyber space is China. Shortly after Morrison's press conference, Australian media citing \"senior sources\" reported that the undisclosed state actor was China. Such allegations have been around for a long time, and relations between the two countries have been tense as never before. But it makes a diplomatic difference whether anonymous sources accuse the Chinese government or the government officially. That would be one of the next possible escalation levels.\n",

            " The financial regulator Bafin is horrified by the balance sheet scandal at the payment service provider Wirecard. \"It is a complete disaster that we see there and it is a shame that something like this happened,\" said Felix Hufeld, President of the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority. \"We are in the midst of the most appalling situation I've ever seen a Dax company in.\" Wirecard had admitted on Monday night that the 1.9 billion euros that the company had posted to trustee accounts very likely do not exist. For this reason, the group is now reviewing the subsequent correction of its balance sheets from previous years. CEO Markus Braun resigned on Friday. Hufeld fully accepts the criticism of the role of the supervisory authorities - including the Bafin. \"We have not been effective enough to prevent this from happening,\" Hufeld admitted. Rapid clarification is now important. Wirecard processes cashless payments for merchants - both at cash registers and online. The company has been in trouble for more than a year since the London Financial Times accused management of a series of accounting manipulations in a series of articles. The financial regulator Bafin and the Munich public prosecutor are investigating various aspects in the Wirecard case. The rating agency Moody's has now completely removed Wirecard's credit rating. The experts had decided to withdraw the ratings because of irregularities in the balance sheet that still need to be resolved, Moody's said. The agency no longer has sufficient information to provide an assessment of the creditworthiness of the payment processor near Munich. On Friday, Moodys's downgraded Wirecard's credit rating by a whole six levels to junk level. The group has admitted that its balance sheet is missing 1.9 billion euros.\n",

            " Jan Marsalek, former Wirecard board member, plans to face the Munich I public prosecutor's office early next week, according to information from the Süddeutsche Zeitung. The sheet learned this from circles of experts in the Munich investigation. The manager is apparently planning a similar procedure to the overthrown Wirecard CEO Markus Braun, who had been released from custody for five million euros bail and other conditions. Marsalek was considered Braun's right-hand man at Wirecard. Marsalek, Braun's right-hand man for years and responsible for the Asian business, is said to have been responsible for the business in the Philippines, which seemed to play a central role in the balance sheet scandal. The missing 1.9 billion euros are said to be in escrow accounts at two Filipino banks. However, the relevant documents turned out to be fake. On Monday, Wirecard then admitted that \"there is an overwhelming probability that these credits will not exist\". This corresponds to about a quarter of the total assets. Following this admission, Marsalek was fired at Wirecard after the company had provisionally released him last week. He is currently allegedly in the Philippines to search for material to clarify the case. It remains to be seen whether he is actually there and whether he really wants to come to Munich and face the investigators. The scandal about suspected manipulation of the balance sheet at the payment service provider is now making more and more customers nervous: in addition to the transport service provider Grab, an Uber competitor, the French telecommunications group Orange also turned away from Wirecard. Aldi-Süd, the airline KLM and the London-based online bank Revolut are also examining the cooperation.\n",

            " After the slump in the German economy as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, sentiment among German exporters recovered significantly in June. The export expectations raised by the Munich Ifo Institute rose by 24.4 points compared to the previous month to minus 2.3 points. That was the strongest monthly increase ever measured, the institute said. \"German industry works its way out of the basement,\" said Ifo President Clemens Fuest. The automotive and pharmaceutical industries are now expecting export growth again in the coming months. According to the information, no further increases in exports are yet expected in the other sectors, but the mood has noticeably brightened. In the chemical industry, companies expect constant exports. In electrical engineering and mechanical engineering, falling foreign sales are still expected, but these are less pronounced than in the previous months. The Ifo Institute survey was conducted among around 2,300 companies. The German Chamber of Commerce and Industry (DIHK) expects a bumpy recovery this year. DIHK foreign trade chief Volker Treier forecast in an interview with the Funke newspapers that exports will decrease by 15 percent this year. \"The majority of German export companies expect the economic recovery to take at least two years,\" said Treier. Companies saw sales decline, leading to liquidity problems. They are therefore dependent on loans and equity is shrinking. \"Pre-financing for an upswing has become more difficult,\" said the DIHK foreign trade chief. But Treier also sees a glimmer of hope: \"Fortunately, the supply chains are not broken.\" China in particular, which is the third most important export country for German companies, is brightening up.\n",

            " After the riots in Stuttgart, the various political camps are horrified by the violence against the forces. Politicians from the CDU, SPD, FDP and the Greens condemned the riots, in which several hundred people devastated downtown Stuttgart on Sunday night. According to the police, there were no further clashes on Monday night. Federal Interior Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU) had a look at the situation on site during a visit on Monday afternoon. Hundreds of people had rioted and attacked police officers in the Baden-Württemberg state capital on Sunday night. Forces were thrown at them with bottles and stones, and numerous businesses were looted. Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier strongly condemned the violent riots and demonstratively backed police officers. \"Violence, vandalism, sheer brutality - as seen at the weekend in Stuttgart - must be persecuted and punished with the severity of the rule of law,\" said Steinmeier in Berlin. \"Anyone who attacks police officers, who makes them contemptible or gives the impression that they belong\" disposed of \", we have to oppose this decisively.\" CDU General Secretary Paul Ziemiak (CDU) told the RTL and n-tv channels that pictures of the events were disturbing and made him \"stunned, even angry\".

The outbreaks of violence must \"be fully investigated and the perpetrators punished consistently\". It is true that \"we have just tightened the punishments for assaulting police officers.\" Baden-Württemberg's Prime Minister Winfried Kretschmann had already taken a clear position on Sunday. \"These acts against people and things are criminal acts that should be persecuted and condemned,\" said the Green politician. It was a \"brutal outbreak of violence\". His thoughts are with the injured police officers and the victims of the looting.

The quality of these violent riots is new. Thomas Strobl, Strobl, Minister of the Interior of Baden-Württemberg, pointed out that there is little evidence of political motivation. That came from the \"party scene\", drugs and alcohol were certainly involved. Dozens of violent small groups devastated downtown Stuttgart during the riots. During a check for a drug offense, many revelers had shown solidarity against the police.

            " Afterwards, being the Federal Chancellor can really be worthwhile if you are not too squeamish when choosing a cash pardon: the employer. See Gerhard Schröder. As Minister of Transport, one can hope for a sufficient follow-up job as a car lobbyist (I suspect Matthias Wissmann is Andreas Scheuer's secret role model). As prime minister, you can then switch to attractive positions in the energy (Wolfgang Clement) or construction (Roland Koch) sectors, and as a former economics minister to a bank (Sigmar Gabriel). Born in 1973, is a cognitive psychologist and has been a professor at the Hamburg University of Applied Sciences (HAW) since autumn 2016. There he is responsible for the \"Digital Communication\" course. Before that he headed the Network World department at SPIEGEL ONLINE. Agriculture minister Julia Klöckner already impressively demonstrates how to elegantly and effectively build stable relationships with potential future employers. And then of course there is Friedrich \"Black Rock\" Merz, whose post-Bundestag tour through supervisory, advisory and administrative boards right up to the excellently paid lobbyist job for the world's largest private wealth manager is certainly exemplary for one or the other young colleague . Unethical behavior is not punished \"Individuals are more likely to act corruptly,\" says an interesting overview study from Norway, \"if they work in organizations where unethical behavior is not punished.\" Which brings us to the actual topic of this column, namely the psychology of taking advantage. To begin with, all of the above have, of course, complied with the law and are beyond any suspicion of corruption in office. Apparently, however, they did not and do not have any ethical and moral problems in selling their contacts and knowledge acquired in office after the political career. And, due to the lack of legal regulations, there are no consequences to fear. Certainly no cross-party outcry. Psychology has known for a long time what is going on. We owe this fact, at least in part, to the lousy reputation of politics and thus part of contemporary populism. Let us take as an example a relevant study from the journal \"Research in Organizational Behavior\" from 2003. It deals with the question of how \"corruption is normalized\". The authors name three factors: \"Institutionalization, whereby an original corrupt decision is embedded in structures and processes and thus made routine\" \"Rationalization, where self-serving ideologies develop to justify or even enhance corruption\" \"Socialization, with naive newcomers is taught to regard corruption as permitted, if not worth striving for. \"Did you also think of Philipp Amthor in\" naive newcomers \"? I would like to bet that Amthor (\"a cool guy\") had the feeling - reinforced by the right-wing German men's association at the \"Augustus\" company - that they tend to do something heroic. After all, the Federal Government really has a lot of catching up to do when it comes to artificial intelligence. Amthor wouldn't be alone. Loud hero Gerhard Schröder said at the time in all seriousness that he was going to the Russian group Rosneft to \"ensure the energy security of Germany and Europe\". When Sigmar Gabriel joined Deutsche Bank, he verbally dissociated himself from colleagues who were \"lazy and relate to pensions\". Ex-Minister of Transport Matthias Wissmann declared himself a \"bridge builder on both sides\" after switching to the car lobby association. All misunderstood heroes. Hamburg CDU MP Christoph Ploß said this week that Philipp Amthor had apologized that he was \"one of our best\", a \"very respectable colleague\". Union parliamentary group deputy Johann Wadephul said that Amthor was \"just young, and it is easier to make wrong decisions in exuberance\". Friedrich Merz actually criticized Amthor, which is a bit funny, but of course also said that he hoped that Amthor \"could continue his political work afterwards\". It always sounds a bit like \"he couldn't have been caught, but there is certainly grass growing over it\". In exuberance In exuberance, Philipp Amthor has organized various meetings between high-ranking politicians and representatives of a company that gave him a director's post. In exuberance he flew around the world drinking champagne, in exuberance he accepted stock options, knowing full well that this would enable him to avoid the reporting obligation in the Bundestag. Let's see what comes next, Amthor prefers not to answer many questions at the moment. Every time a politician is caught in this country that he or she is a little bit close to people with a lot of money and very specific interests, the same thing happens: the critics are assumed to be foreign and naive. Naivety is the cynic's favorite accusation. It is insisted on the \"presumption of innocence\" (Wadephul). Reasons are sought why in this case it is actually a casual sin (\"just yet young\"). In no case is it discussed whether such behavior is simply not unacceptable for an elected MP who owes his power to the electorate. Another sentence from one of the Norwegian studies cited above: \"Rationalization narratives seem to make corruption more acceptable.\" The problem is not an individual one, but a systemic one. Why is there no lobby register? This pact of \"something must be in there somehow\" extends across party borders. Sure, the SPD is now finding that stock options may also have to be reported. But nobody really wants to make a noise. Could be that you want to have a nice job yourself later. It is fitting that there is still no lobby register in Germany, although everyone is actually for it. The current waiting period regulation for changing ministers in companies is nothing more than a fig leaf. Another sentence from the Norwegian review cited above: \"Practitioners should support measures that improve information flows about the cost of corruption, reward ethical behavior, set basic standards for integrity, and improve decision-making in organizations.\" Shorter: As is so often the case, there is no problem of knowledge, but an implementation problem. That damages trust in democracy.\n",

            " SPIEGEL: A manager of the Tönnies group said on Wednesday that they \"fought like lions\" to keep the virus out of the company. How credible is that? Brümmer: I don't think so at all. Of course there is no absolute protection, but here we experience that one roared outside like a lion and inside acted like a kitten. SPIEGEL: Why? Brümmer: If more than 600 infected people show up at the Tönnies headquarters in Rheda-Wiedenbrück out of around 1,000, this indicates that a hotspot is fermenting longer. SPIEGEL: There is a video circulating on the net that comes from the Tönnies canteen. The workers sit close together here, it is extremely risky. Tönnies sometimes gave the date in late March and sometimes in early April. Now, according to SWR, it shows that it dates from April 8 - before the first mass outbreaks at slaughterhouses and the extended protective measures at Tönnies. Brümmer: It remains a scandal. Employees are deliberately exposed to a health risk. That is inhumane. Tönnies also has to comply with the lockdown regulations in the country and here it is obviously violated.

            " It started with a big booze. Hundreds of teenagers and twens met on Saturday evening at Eckensee in the center of Stuttgart to party. Because of the corona restrictions, this is currently only possible outside, clubs and discotheques may not open in the state capital of Baden-Württemberg. The party-goers drank schnapps and roared. When police officers checked a drug offense, the situation escalated. According to the police, a 17-year-old German should be checked for a drug offense at around 11.30 p.m. as part of a BTM procedure. As a result, 200 to 300 people from the so-called Stuttgart party scene immediately expressed solidarity with the young man and massively attacked the police officers who were present. The group of attackers grew to 400 to 500 people within a short time. Police officers were thrown at them with bottles and stones. During a medical emergency, the emergency services were attacked and disabled. It was an outbreak of violence that Stuttgart had never seen before in this form. The rioters moved in groups towards Schlossplatz. They smashed the windows of parked patrol cars with poles. They threw glass bottles and paving stones at passing police vehicles. Some called \"fuck the police\", others attacked officials. \"There were pieces of glass everywhere,\" an eyewitness reports to SPIEGEL. The police then cleared the place to the north. \"The kids ran incredibly fast.\" More than 280 security officers were deployed. But they failed to gain control. All over the city center, the attackers disguised with masks indiscriminately destroyed businesses, from the one-euro shop to the jeweler. Police helicopters flew over the city. In the short news service Twitter, video recordings of young men who kicked shop windows or tore paving stones from the floor were circulating. A video shows a hooded attacker jumping into the back of a police officer. At a press conference on Sunday afternoon, the Stuttgart police gave the first information on the extent of the riots: According to this, 19 police officers were injured, one of whom was unable to work. 24 people were arrested, of which twelve were German nationals. Seven of them were to be brought before the judge and placed in custody. 40 stores were damaged, nine of them were also looted. Patrol cars were damaged, twelve of them were no longer operational. The Vice-Police President in Stuttgart, Thomas Berger, expressly praised the emergency services who would have got the situation under control under the most difficult conditions. This took several hours, and the situation did not calm down until around 4.30 a.m. Police President Lutz spoke of \"incredible events that left me stunned\". The violence had an unprecedented dimension. Lutz expects further arrests. \"I strongly condemn this brutal outbreak of violence,\" said Prime Minister Winfried Kretschmann (Greens) about the incident. \"These acts against people and things are criminal acts that should be persecuted and condemned.\" The pictures from downtown Stuttgart couldn't leave you cold. \"Our thoughts are with the injured police officers and the victims of the looting.\" Baden-Württemberg's interior minister Thomas Strobl (CDU) wants to act against the rioters with the full severity of the rule of law - looting, rioting and marauding violent criminals will not be tolerated in the southwest. A 40-person investigation team has been set up at the Stuttgart Police Headquarters, and the State Criminal Police Office will support the investigation. Strobl wants to inform the state parliament in a special meeting of the interior committee on Wednesday. While the police have no certainty about the provenance of the rioters, some have already determined it. Right-wing populists like Alice Weidel tried to use the incidents politically on social media: \"Antifa and 'Migrantifa' out of control, police officers injured!\" Wrote the AfD parliamentary group leader in the Bundestag on Twitter. On the other hand, eyewitnesses report that the mob was a heterogeneous group: people with a migration background were among the semi-strong - and without. It was also not a question of politically motivated violence by left-wing demonstrators. \"The perpetrators must be quickly identified and held responsible,\" tweeted CDU general secretary Paul Ziemiak. Evidence has extensively examined downtown Stuttgart. The police are asking to upload possible pictures and videos on the internet on an information portal. After the situation had calmed down again on Sunday, a large part of the forces deployed to the capital from other parts of Baden-Württemberg were able to return home. But there was a hangover mood. The shop windows of several mobile phone shops were broken, an ice cream parlor and a well-known clothing store were damaged in the riots. The police do not seem to want to take any risks: For security reasons, a large contingent remains in the city center, it said. With material from dpa\n",

            " A travel portal may cancel an Israeli citizen's flight against the customer's will because of its nationality. In this specific case, the Israeli could not have entered Kuwait due to his citizenship during a stopover - the airline therefore withdrew the man's ticket. The Higher Regional Court (OLG) Munich confirmed the process (Az. 20 U 6415/19). The Israeli living in Germany had sued because he wanted to travel from Munich to Sri Lanka in 2018. He should have made a stopover in Kuwait City. The online travel portal canceled the initially confirmed booking because he was not allowed to enter the country due to the \"Uniform Law on boycotting Israel\". The man filed a complaint and asked for compensation. The Landshut Regional Court had previously dismissed the lawsuit (file number 24 O 61/19), and the OLG has now confirmed this decision. It did not see compensation claims. The appeal against the judgment was not allowed. \"This law (...) is not significant for German courts because it contradicts fundamental fundamental values ​​of the German legal system\", the court said. The booked performance of the transport is excluded \"because of the actual impossibility\". The taking of evidence showed that \"the plaintiff simply does not actually have to travel to Kuwait as the holder of an Israeli passport\" - even if he only wants to change to another plane there.\n",

One who presents Germany in a future-oriented industry at world level, right in the heart of digital capitalism. What could Wirecard have been for Germany ... Now the name no longer stands for hopes for Germany as a business location. It stands for a disgrace. The drama surrounding the Dax group is a catastrophe for the reputation of the German financial industry and the miserable German stock market culture. If it comes as no surprise, the group could turn out to be the biggest air number in the history of the stock exchange here and become extremely embarrassing for Germany's financial regulators, its auditors and part of the media.

Patients listened to the audience from a nearby clinic. Everyone was wearing a pacemaker. You should not only enjoy the short concert, you were also part of a scientific experiment. Chew regularly appears as a pianist. Her main job, however, is a mathematician at the Paris-based research laboratory Sciences et Technologies de la Musique et du Son. She is currently commuting between the French and British capital. The researcher, who developed a mathematical model to analyze the perception of music, among other things, suffered from cardiac arrhythmias. This prompted her to base her compositions on EKGs from people with such arrhythmias. Chew's recent project, it is obvious, unites their interests quite well. In her concert audience, she and her research colleagues wanted to investigate how the human heart reacts to music - to changes in tempo, volume, and pauses. Pacemaker patients are suitable subjects because their heart rate can be set and the scientists can concentrate on a single measurement: the fraction of a second during which the heart recovers between two beats.

            " The revenue of the German tax authorities collapsed by 19.9 percent within a year due to the corona pandemic in May. \"The economic impact of the corona crisis and the tax measures taken as a result of this crisis put a significant strain on tax revenue in May 2020,\" the Federal Ministry of Finance said on Friday in its monthly report. In the first five months of 2020, total revenues decreased by 6.3 percent compared to the same period in the previous year. While sales tax revenue fell by 21 percent in May, wages tax fell by a good ten percent. Due to the almost halted air traffic, the revenue from the air traffic tax even fell by almost 97 percent. The federal government wants to overcome the economic slump as a result of the coronavirus crisis with a record new debt of over 218 billion euros. The cabinet launched its second supplementary budget on Wednesday, which increased the scope for new debts by EUR 62.5 billion. In the first quarter, the economy shrank by 2.2 percent, which is the highest rate since the 2009 financial crisis. According to economists, the slump in the second quarter, which is about to end, will be significantly larger at around ten percent. However, the Ministry of Finance expects a gradual recovery. \"Against the backdrop of the current easing of lockdown measures, industrial production is expected to recover in the next few months, although the old level is unlikely to be reached again for the time being.\"\n",

After the bear showed up surprisingly, the younger one fell in terror. The animal leaned over him, whereupon the father pounced on the bear. Bears were reintroduced in Trentino, and several dozen live in the mountain region, which is popular with tourists. There are always problems between humans and animals. In April a \"problem bear\" searched for months fell into the trap. The bear with the number \"M49\" had previously broken out of a care station. Every now and then animals migrate across the border, some are supposed to make it to southern Germany.

            " The head of the Federal Employment Agency (BA) speaks of a historic slump: The number of unemployed in Germany is likely to rise to over three million again in summer due to the corona crisis for the first time in ten years. \"We will probably exceed the three million mark in the summer,\" said BA boss Detlef Scheele of the \"Süddeutsche Zeitung\". Unemployment was last so high five years ago in the seasonally more difficult winter labor market. The Institute for Labor Market and Vocational Research (IAB), the research agency of the Federal Employment Agency, had already thought that an increase to three million was possible in March. With Scheele's statements, there is now an unofficial confirmation of this trend. Most recently, the number of unemployed rose to around 2.8 million or 6.1 percent in May. The number of underemployed people, which also includes unemployed people in training, was even higher. Scheele hopes that the situation will improve after the summer. In order for the unemployment rate to fall again in the fall, the easing of the corona restrictions in the catering or travel industry would now have to take effect, world trade should get going and the federal government's economic stimulus package \"ignite\". The corporation crisis hit temporary workers and temporary workers particularly hard, said the BA boss. Youth unemployment is also increasing. The corona crisis has a double negative effect on women. They are more active in particularly affected industries than men and thus earn less. At the same time, they would have to take on more care tasks. \"I very much hope that four months of Corona will not destroy everything that has been achieved in decades of equality in the labor market. We must do everything we can to prevent this from happening,\" said Scheele.\n",

            " After the billion-dollar balance sheet scandal, the payment service provider Wirecard has filed an application with the Munich District Court to open insolvency proceedings. \"The management board of Wirecard AG has decided to file an application for the opening of insolvency proceedings for Wirecard AG with the Munich district court because of impending insolvency and over-indebtedness,\" it said in a message. It will be checked whether bankruptcy applications for Wirecard subsidiaries must also be filed. The Wirecard share was suspended from trading for 60 minutes and then temporarily lost 80 percent of its value. In the meantime, it was only 2.50 euros. Since the shift in the balance sheet for 2019 in the previous week and the admission of alleged air bookings worth billions, the share certificates have now lost almost 98 percent. The reason is a balance sheet scandal. Wirecard's annual balance sheet lacks 1.9 billion euros. The group believes that the money at two Filipino banks \"almost certainly\" does not exist. Wirecard's creditor banks had the right to terminate loans of over two billion euros because the company had not submitted a certified balance sheet for the previous year until Friday. EY's auditors had refused the attestation when it emerged that escrow account confirmations were evidently forged. The public prosecutor's office in Munich I accuses Wirecard boss Markus Braun, who resigned last week, of having inflated Wirecard's total assets and sales volume with fake receipts along with other suspected perpetrators. Braun was briefly arrested on Tuesday and later released on bail of five million euros. Previously, he had raised a total of 155 million euros in a series of share sales, as Wirecard said in several ad hoc releases. \"We are investigating all possible crimes,\" said a spokeswoman for the Munich I public prosecutor's office. The authorities are already investigating Wirecard boss Braun and three other top managers on suspicion of misinformation from investors in two mandatory stock exchange notices. At the heart of the balance sheet scandal are the former Wirecard CFO in Southeast Asia and a trustee who worked for Wirecard until the end of 2019 and who - as has now turned out - was probably responsible for largely non-existent business with the third parties. The British \"Financial Times\" reported about possible manipulation of balance sheets at Wirecard over a year ago. In October the \"FT\" then reported that a significant part of Wirecard's sales with third-party companies in Asia may be based on bogus transactions. Braun had rejected the \"FT\" reporting for months as baseless. As the Wirecard share price had dropped sharply on the Frankfurt stock exchange after the first \"FT\" articles, the financial regulator Bafin and the Munich public prosecutor had initiated investigations into whether the price manipulation by speculators was the cause.\n",

It is therefore clear that \"a two-thirds majority must be achieved in the vote, which, according to the latest statements by important shareholders, does not appear to be certain, particularly on the terms of the capital increase,\" writes Spohr. The shareholders will vote on the planned rescue package at an extraordinary general meeting next Thursday. If the shareholder presence is below 50 percent, a two-thirds majority of the voting rights is required. Major Lufthansa shareholder Heinz Hermann Thiele, who recently held a good 15 percent of the shares, criticized the agreement between the federal government and Lufthansa and called for renegotiations of the rescue plan. However, Thiele left it open whether he would vote against it at the Annual General Meeting. Lufthansa fears that the presence of the shareholders at the general meeting will be too low and Thiele could block the rescue plan - with an uncertain outcome for the airline or bankruptcy. A protective shield procedure is also conceivable, as is currently going through the Condor airline. \"In the event that the general meeting does not give approval for the federal stabilization measures, we have made extensive preparations, among other things, to prevent grounding,\" Spohr wrote in the employee letter. \"We would also use the remaining time before filing for bankruptcy to discuss options with the federal government.\"\n",

            " After the massive corona outbreak at Germany's largest meat producer Tönnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, further steps to contain the focus of the infection are emerging. According to the authorities, experts from the Robert Koch Institute and other scientists are working in the Gütersloh district. State Health Minister Karl-Josef Laumann has now announced that there may be more contact closures in the Gütersloh district. \"What we are thinking about today, whether we might do more in the area of ​​contact closures again,\" said the CDU politician in an interview with broadcaster Bayern 2. He said: \"We will certainly announce the appropriate steps today and the Prime Minister will also comment on the topic today. \" Prime Minister of North Rhine-Westphalia Armin Laschet (CDU) tweeted: The recommendations of the experts \"follow further measures\". Laschet wants to speak publicly at 10.30 a.m. about the current situation of the coronavirus pandemic in his state. After the outbreak in the meat factory in Rheda-Wiedenbrück with more than 1,500 infected employees, who have been diagnosed, SPD health expert Karl Lauterbach recently requested a short lockdown with massive tests. He warned of the free travel of people from the Gütersloh region. The district district administrator, Sven-Georg Adenauer, believes a lockdown in the region is conceivable. \"I would say yes,\" said the CDU politician when asked whether it \"smelled\" of a lockdown. The mobile teams that are on the move in the apartments and accommodations and also address family members have now entered a certain dark field. \"In this respect, this is a new situation for me.\" The mobile teams would have found some positive cases in their use. This could indicate that the outbreak is no longer limited to workers at the meat factory. Laschet's health minister Laumann gave at least an inkling of what steps are now imminent in the Bayern 2 interview. Laumann said that the current situation in the Gütersloh district is already a lockdown: \"We have 7,000 people in quarantine, we have closed the schools and kindergartens. We will now also carry out cross-tests in the population. If someone says we do not have a lockdown in the district of Gütersloh, then go there. We're in the middle of a lockdown. \" On the other hand, closing restaurants or gyms doesn't make much sense, Laumann said. \"Because, for example, the people who work there as Eastern European contract workers do not go to restaurants. We have to take a measure that also fits this situation. We are not dealing with an infection across the population like that for Example after Ischgl was the case. \" First and foremost, they are people who \"do not participate in large areas of social life at all.\" Laumann reiterated his criticism of the way the meat industry works in Germany: \"I believe that this system has not proven itself and that we also need clear legal regulations, that those who own slaughterhouses also have a responsibility for the workers who do the core business of a slaughterhouse, namely slaughtering and cutting up animals. \"\n",

According to Federal Labor Minister Hubertus Heil (SPD), the meat company Tönnies will be liable for damage caused by the incident. \"The company must have civil liability,\" Heil said on Sunday of the \"Bild\" newspaper. Anyone who triggers the spread of the corona virus by violating the rules must also be liable for it. Heil does not assume that the Tönnies Group must be supported with funds from the state rescue packages. The company had \"made an incredible amount of money\" in recent years. Chef Clemens Tönnies had publicly apologized for the outbreak of the pathogen among employees of his company on Saturday. The group is \"fully responsible,\" he said. Green party leader Anton Hofreiter appealed to him to cover the costs incurred from his private assets. If Tönnies is serious about his apology, \"he would pay the costs out of his private assets - not from his company assets,\" Hofreiter told the \"Bild\". According to the Gütersloh district, in which Rheda-Wiedenbrück is located, the series tests on the Tönnies site were completed on Saturday. Accordingly, there were initially 5,899 findings. 1331 of these were positive, more than a fifth. The entire Tönnies workforce is currently in quarantine. The series of coronavirus outbreaks in the German meat industry has sparked a debate about working conditions there and the low prices for meat products. The federal cabinet had already launched new requirements for the industry in May. Among other things, there is a ban on contracts for work, which is to apply from January 1, 2021. According to this, only employees of their own company should be allowed to slaughter and cut animals. At this point you will find an external content that complements the article.

Many observers praise Germany's presidency as an opportunity in times of Corona. At the Corporate Europe Observatory and at Lobbycontrol, however, there are fears that \"industry in the main role\" could ultimately be involved. This is the subtitle of a report that the two lobby-critical associations published together with numerous other non-governmental organizations on Tuesday and which SPIEGEL was able to see in advance. Many case studies describe how large certain sectors influence the federal government and its EU policies. Three examples: Auto industry - with ministerial help against limit values ​​The close ties between German car manufacturers and the Federal Government are an open secret. For example, her lobby association VDA is currently managed by former Merkel employee Hildegard Müller. Under pressure from the industry, Germany repeatedly campaigned for lax EU requirements. Economics Minister Peter Altmaier (CDU) wrote a letter to the Commission in January in which he refused to change the CO2 limit values ​​by 2030 as part of the Green Deal. The manufacturers recently underlined this demand at a crisis meeting with the federal government - this time with reference to the corona crisis. \"The automotive industry is doing nothing other than playing one crisis against the other,\" the study says. The battle for new emission targets was \"far from over\". Tax policy - brakes on concerns about the export model The USA has just left negotiations on the taxation of digital corporations. Now it was time to find a European solution. In fact, the EU Commission already presented such plans in 2018, which were blocked by Germany and some other countries. Warnings from lobby associations such as the industry association BDI were apparently successful that the tax could bring disadvantages for Germany's export-oriented economic model. Federal Minister of Finance Olaf Scholz (SPD) instead relied on those negotiations led by the industrialized countries club OECD from which the US is now leaving. \"Because of his rejection of the EU proposal, Scholz no longer has Plan B,\" the authors write. \"The finance minister and the German presidency need to rethink their position and should instead support a solid proposal for an EU digital tax.\" Fisheries - An industry leader negotiates with EU quota has sparked repeated arguments, and in the UK they have even made fishermen vocal supporters of Brexit. For years, the member countries have been setting quotas that are above the scientific recommendations and lead to overfishing. In Germany, the Dutch group Parlevliet & van der Plas (P&P), which is responsible for around two thirds of fishing with just eight large ships, is particularly benefiting from this. P&P has good connections to the government, so Angela Merkel christened the P&P trawler \"Mark\" in 2015. P&P chief executive Diek Parlevliet was even part of an EU delegation that negotiated with Norway, other fishery representatives used press passes to gain access to the EU council building. According to the lobby critics, Germany should ensure that the ministers of fisheries finally follow the recommendations of science this autumn - and \"really do not give any representatives of the fish industry access to the committees\". The federal government \"represents the interests of large corporations too often when it comes to key issues,\" says the study. Particularly noticeable in the case studies is the role of Economics Minister Peter Altmaier, whose department, together with the Foreign Ministry, coordinates Germany's position on EU issues. Altmaier \"often uses this responsibility to position the Federal Government early in the interests of corporate interests, not infrequently to the detriment of the public interest\". Of the Brussels institutions, the Council in particular is targeted by the lobbyism critics, i.e. the body of the Member States. While lobby companies that are not registered in the EU lobby register may no longer have access to the European Parliament and EU commissioners have had to publish meetings with industry representatives on their websites for a long time, such requirements are still rather the exception with the Council. With their study, the lobby critics also want to use the momentum that the Amthor case has created for a binding lobby register in Germany. The Brussels register is not perfect, but it could still serve as a role model - because at least in retrospect it is possible to find out which companies are meeting which MEPs or Commissioners. \"Germany must finally introduce a mandatory lobby register for the federal government and the Bundestag,\" says the study. Recently, even the BDI has shown itself open to such demands. Great need for discussion in the car lobby At least there is already a little more transparency, the emerging presidency may have played a role in this. The meetings of the two German EU ambassadors with business representatives have been published since the end of 2019 - an important step, even if Lobbycontrol criticized that the topics of the meetings are not listed. The data so far show that since the interruption due to Corona, it seems that the automotive industry in particular has had to talk. In contrast to the presidencies of other countries, there will also be no sponsorship during the German Council Presidency. At most, the reference to regionally manufactured products should be allowed. For example, a notice could be given at the council meeting when Swabian pretzels are served. There will be no press conferences in front of Audi rings or Mercedes stars. Romania still had support from Coca-Cola in 2019. And one more detail shows that people have become more sensitive to industrial influence: At the last German EU Council Presidency in 2007, it was still common for the German auto industry to make its limousines available for large meetings under the Council Presidency. This time Germany does not use this service.\n",

            " Experiments in the UK confirm a 50-year-old theory that black holes can possibly be used for energy. According to the considerations of the physicist Roger Penrose in 1969, this could happen if an object is directed into the outer area of ​​a black hole, where all matter inevitably rotates - unless it moves faster than light. In this case the object would receive negative energy. If the object is now split into two parts, one of which disappears in the black hole, the recoil action would release energy. However, only a highly developed civilization would likely be able to do so, in other words, aliens. Researchers at the University of Glasgow have now found a way to prove the effect in an experiment, they report in the journal \"Nature Physics\". To do this, they directed a ring of loudspeakers onto a rotating disk made of foam, which acted as a sound absorber and was intended to simulate the black hole. \"If the disc rotates fast enough, something strange happens,\" explains physicist Marion Cromb from the University of Glasgow, \"the frequency of the noise changes from a positive frequency to a negative one and thereby virtually steals energy from the rotating surface.\" Tapes have recorded the effect. They can be heard how the loudspeaker noises become quieter when they hit the rotating disk. But then the volume suddenly increases again. The noise is then even louder than the original sound. A similar phenomenon can also be seen in ambulances, Comb says. Although their siren always sounds the same, the sound is higher when the ambulance approaches. This is because the sound is compressed. In contrast, when the ambulance moves away, people perceive the sound more deeply. Physicists speak of the Doppler effect. \"It is strange to imagine that we were able to confirm a cosmic theory from 50 years ago here in our laboratory in western Scotland,\" says physicist Daniele Faccio, who also worked on the study. \"But we believe that this will open many new avenues for scientific research.\" Editor's note: In an earlier version of this text, the Doppler effect was incorrectly described. It does not refer to the volume, but to the frequency of a noise. We have corrected the text accordingly.\n",

            " When the Tomingas family moved to the north of Nuremberg in 1964, they could hardly believe their luck: 63 square meters for mother, son and daughter, a shower with warm water. \"Not that we got lost,\" recalls René Tomingas, \"but sometimes we just walked through the rooms and enjoyed it.\" The new luxury of West German normality has only one disadvantage: the tomingas' feet hurt from the hard stone floor. You are only used to wooden floors. René Tomingas today René Tomingas spent the first 18 years of his life in barracks in the camps for \"displaced persons\", the longest since 1953 in the so-called Valka camp in Nuremberg. The UNRRA (United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) established the camp for foreigners who had become homeless in 1946; until 1949 it was also used to intern former SS members. Today there is the Nuremberg satellite city of Langwasser, a settlement of functional apartment blocks. The National Socialists used the free area of ​​the Nazi Party Rally Grounds, later called Langwasser, in a variety of ways: First, participants of the bombastic Nazi Party Days were accommodated in tent cities, and from 1939 prisoners of war and forced laborers were locked in the resulting camp structure. René Tomingas, born in Ulm to Estonian parents, comes to Langwasser's Valka camp at the age of seven. It is already his ninth stop after camps in Geislingen, Pforzheim, Feldafing and elsewhere. He still does not know why the family was relocated so often: \"The organizations that were responsible for us closed a camp here, opened a new one there, whatever the plan.\" Tominga's father, an Estonian soldier, was missing before René's birth, and his fate remains unknown to this day. The Nazis abducted his mother as a slave laborer. Valka camp seems the next bad lot for mother and son. They reached it on February 19, 1953. In the wooden barrack, the windows hardly closed, the wind carried snow into the room, and a wood stove did not heat up against the cold. And 70 of the indistinguishable barracks are lined up outside. \"It was catastrophic. I missed Feldafing insanely.\" In this Valka camp, named after an Estonian-Latvian border town, there are many from the Baltic States. Between 1946 and 1960, up to 4,000 people from around 30 nations lived close together. Terrifying stories of residents who smash each other's heads in the notorious camp penetrate into nearby Nuremberg. \"Wennsd ned brov bisd, kummsd no Valga-Lochä\", the mothers threaten naughty children - if you are not good you come to the Valka camp. Alfred Strobel / SZ Photo The Nuremberg Valka warehouse - revolving door to a better life A little later, mother and son share a ten square meter room in one of the new stone barracks. René Tomingas describes them as inferior and hardly insulated, all residents share a toilet and a tap. \"You can imagine the hygienic conditions,\" says Tomingas. \"And yet it was a great time for me, for many Valka children,\" characterized by a feeling of freedom. The young René leaves the barrack directly through the window and meets playmates from all over the world, they roam the neighboring forests. Particularly fond of where American occupation soldiers are currently practicing maneuvers - and lure them with chocolate and chewing gum. Cowboys and Indians can also be played wonderfully in the camp; concrete troughs and a pit for no apparent purpose are suitable as hiding places. \"If we had known what that was, we would not have done it. That was the remains of the latrines for the Nazi tent cities.\" René comes into contact with religion for the first time. There is a Protestant, Catholic and Orthodox church in the camp. \"With my Polish friends I went to the Catholic, with the others to the Evangelical. I really enjoyed it.\" The boy wants to be a pastor. The school, on the other hand, demands little from him. The teachers in the camp would have seen little point in teaching them, these foreign children. The boys often say goodbye to the first break. They form a youth service, because German children from the area, especially displaced people from Silesia and the Sudetenland, try to enter the camp. \"They opened windows and cut clotheslines with us, probably instigated by their parents,\" says Tomingas. The children meet to defend their camp and are ready with sticks and stones when the others approach. And they say something that has a completely different meaning for their parents: \"After school, we go to war.\" The schools are later merged, and the Valka children are now attending those in Langwasser. The parents had to deal with fear, says Tomingas: \"The children had to march to school in a convoy, under the protection of their parents. For us it was of course a feeling of power. We were pleased that we are now the strong ones . \" Around the DP camp, displaced people meet Germans, Germans meet the victims of their war. \"Displaced persons\" include former prisoners of war, forced laborers and concentration camp inmates. Most do not want to stay and hope for an exit permit to the USA, Canada or Sweden; many have no work. The Valka camp is nothing more than a passage, a waiting room on the way to a better life. The tomingas have to stay. The mother is refused entry due to pulmonary tuberculosis. The mood in the Valka camp is charged, it is not always peaceful. In 1950 SPIEGEL reported a \"melee\" with two dead and 30 injured. René Tomingas remembers, for example, that the Croatians preferred to stay in on the Serbian national holiday and vice versa. But: \"In view of the many peoples, it is admirable how little has happened. I was only afraid of Germans, never of people in the camp.\" The city of Nuremberg wants to close the camp as soon as possible so that it can push ahead with its Langwasser housing project. From 1949, the Valka camp accommodated foreigners, especially Czechs, who were also homeless and escaped from the Eastern Bloc countries. The refugee office staff also live in the camp. From 1953, with the adoption of the Geneva Convention, the competent authority was the Federal Agency for the Recognition of Foreign Refugees. In this way, long water becomes the nucleus of today's Federal Office for Migration and Refugees. In 1960 the camp was already thinned out and was about to be closed. The Tomingas, the three of them with René's little sister since 1957, are looking for an apartment and will remain until 1964. After eleven years in the Valka camp, sometimes the largest of its kind in Bavaria, they say goodbye with melancholy, recalls René Tomingas. On the other hand, he is in the middle of puberty, girls are now more interesting than anything else - no time for gloom. René Tomingas doesn't want to be a pastor anymore, he especially wants to leave Germany. Which profession is in demand all over the world? He decides to become a doctor - and he can do it. Most recently, he was chief physician at the Nuremberg Land hospitals and is now retired. Because of love he stayed at the time: his first wife, an Estonian, had different, more beautiful experiences with Germany and the Germans. It was she who absolutely wanted to stay. In retrospect, he sees the Valka camp more than anything else as a school of tolerance. \"A good friend of mine was a Czech, a Latvian, a Pole, a Lithuanian,\" says René Tomingas. \"I think you can only hate what you don't know.\"\n",

            " On Monday evening, Apple introduced new versions of its operating systems for iPhones, iPads, Macs, TV boxes and smartwatches and announced that it would be developing its own desktop and mobile computers with processors it had developed itself. While the first Macs with \"Apple inside\" are not expected until the end of the year, developers can download the first software updates now. So-called public beta versions of the new systems are to be made available to all other Apple users in July, i.e. preliminary versions that may still contain errors. In order to shorten the waiting time until then, we have summarized the most important new announcements from Monday evening below: At the end of the year, Apple wants to introduce the first new Mac that runs an Apple-owned processor instead of an Intel chip. Over the course of the next two years, all Macs will gradually be converted to Apple chips. In the coming years, software called Rosetta 2 should ensure that software developed for Intel chips also runs on the new computers. Otherwise, Apple endeavors to motivate third-party developers to adapt their programs to the new technology. An interesting side effect: Since the new Mac chips are based on the same principles as the iPhone and iPad chips, iOS and iPad OS apps will also work on the computers. It remains to be seen how well such apps can be operated on a computer without a touchscreen. Unlike many manufacturers of Windows computers, Apple is vehemently opposed to installing touch screens in Macs. Microsoft introduced something similar on its Surface computers years ago, and Apple had tried it on its Newton pen computer over the past century: on iPad, handwritten notes can be converted to text using iPadOS 14. The software can also improve sketches, for example by straightening shaky lines or correcting geometric shapes. The AirPods headphones should be able to switch automatically between different devices in the future. For example, if you watch a video on your Mac but then take a call on the iPhone, they automatically switch the connection from Mac to iPhone. The AirPods Pro should also be able to produce surround sound, taking into account the position of the listener in the room itself, meaning that you always hear a certain voice or musical instrument in the same place, no matter how you turn your head. For the Apple Watch, a function is being supplied that many users have been waiting for, because it can now also analyze their sleep. Among other things, movements and the breathing rhythm are recorded. In order to use this function, at least 30 percent battery capacity must be available. If in doubt, the watch warns users during the day to recharge them before going to bed. The large selection of iPhone apps is pleasing on the one hand and a problem on the other. Anyone who loads a lot of apps on the iPhone easily loses the overview. The so-called app media library is supposed to keep things organized by clearly sorting apps, e.g. summarizing all games, putting all social networks and all recently installed applications in one folder. After Google and Microsoft, Apple is also introducing a translation app that can translate texts as well as spoken language. There are 11 languages ​​to choose from, including German, French, English, Russian, Chinese and Portuguese. To ensure consistent protection of personal data, language packs can be loaded onto the cell phone so that the translation function can work offline. With iOS 14 you can use your iPhone to unlock and start your car. The digital car key is stored as software on the device and can be shared with others via the Messages app, for example, sometimes. Sounds exciting, but for the time being it only works with the new 5-series from BMW. In the future, apps will have to be given permission to track by the user. In addition, Apple wants to introduce something like a traffic light function for data protection in its app stores and specify for each app what data it collects from a user and whether it shares it with other companies. The information will come from the providers themselves, which is why it cannot be ruled out that there will be black sheep trying to hide or hide such information. For apps that use the location of the user, you can specify whether they can retrieve the exact or only an approximate position. The \"Where's?\" App, which can be used to locate your Apple devices or friends, will also work with third-party devices in the future. According to Apple, users should then be able to \"localize other objects that are important for their lives\", provided that they are equipped with the necessary radio technology. The principle is reminiscent of that of the Tile Bluetooth tracker. It is difficult to foresee what effects the new mini-apps, which Apple has called app clips, will have. Each of them is basically a single function taken from an app, for example the rental function of an e-scooter rental. App clips can be integrated into websites and can be shared via chat, for example. You can also call them up using a QR code on a brochure. Because they should be a maximum of ten megabytes in size, they can be loaded quickly and can also be used to pay, for example, a rental scooter, using Apple Pay. Once loaded, app clips are saved for 30 days for reuse and are then automatically deleted.\n",

            " A man in Bavaria escaped naked from a hospital after a series of crimes. Police said the night of Wednesday night that he had arrested the man after a car accident with a stolen license plate and taken him to a hospital shortly afterwards because he complained of severe pain. During the arrest, the 23-year-old attacked and injured two officers, the authorities said. When the man woke up in the intensive care unit, he hit the staff with his fists and a fire extinguisher and fled naked. According to the police, he first escaped on a bicycle and hit the employee of a security service at a neighboring construction site with the fire extinguisher. Then he tried to stop a driver and steal his vehicle. However, the driver successfully resisted the fire extinguisher attacks. The 23-year-old was arrested again a short time later and referred to a specialist clinic because of the considerable risk to others. According to the police, he had recently used drugs. Two police officers were so seriously injured when they were first arrested that they were unable to work until further notice. According to the investigators, the security guard, the attacked car driver and several employees of the hospital also suffered injuries.\n",

            " After corona outbreaks, the virologist Christian Drosten fears a new unnoticed spread of the corona virus to the population in North Rhine-Westphalia, among others. The Charité scientist said on Tuesday in the NDR podcast that preventing the spread beyond the region now affected is now the decisive factor. In general, there are currently clear signs in several places, including Berlin, that Sars-CoV-2 is coming back more often. The protective measures were tightened on Tuesday after the Corona outbreak at the meat processor Tönnies in Gütersloh in the neighboring district of Warendorf. From the virologist's point of view, great caution should be taken to prevent a second wave from developing. He referred to the situation in the southern United States, where a \"terrible situation\" is developing despite the high ambient temperatures. There was loosened too early. At the beginning of the pandemic, scientists had hoped that the upcoming summer - and the associated higher temperatures - could slow the spread of the virus. \"I am not optimistic that in a month we will still have the peaceful situation we have now in terms of epidemic activity,\" said Drosten. \"In two months, I think we'll have a problem if we don't turn on all the alarm sensors again now.\" The population must understand that the health authorities need support and consensus. Talks with Drosten will take a summer break until the end of August, as the moderator announced. In the meantime, other scientists are to speak on the podcast channel on the subject of corona. Note: In a first version of this message, a quote from Christian Drosten was shortened in the opening credits: \"We will have a problem in two months,\" it said. The full quote is: \"In two months, I think we'll have a problem if we don't turn on all the alarm sensors again now.\" So it was in the text, in the opening credits we added it later.\n",

            " Rebecca Black reportedly had no plans to start a pop star career in 2011. The then 13-year-old only wanted to pursue her passion, singing, she says today. Her mother therefore commissioned ARK Music Factory to produce a song and music video for a few thousand dollars. Black selected a track from a catalog, and a few of her school friends served as extras for the video. The result was \"Friday\", a trashy song that could have passed the world unnoticed after its release. But after comedians accidentally discovered the teenager's video on YouTube a month later, their song became the laughing stock of the whole world. In thousands of comments, they declared \"Friday\" the worst song ever. At this point you will find external content from YouTube that complements the article. You can show it with a click and hide it again.\n",

            " For Rebecca Black, the overnight fame was a shock. \"I never thought I would have 100 million views on YouTube at that age,\" she says in retrospect. \"I thought that I would only play in the musical in high school.\" The normal teenage life was over for Black after \"Friday\". It's been nine years since then. Black is 23 today and releases music again - this time he wrote it himself. \"My life could have been completely different,\" says the young woman, who had to experience the bad things on the internet early on. But instead of concluding bitterly with this chapter, it is almost all the more vulnerable in spite of defiance. \"I've spent the past ten years lying to myself and the world,\" she said, \"said everything was fine, even if it wasn't.\" In 2020, Rebecca Black no longer sang awkwardly from the anticipation for the weekend, but spoke openly about depression, bullying and her sexuality. At the beginning of the year, she described in a tweet how the hate she experienced online became self-hatred. But she also reports on her YouTube channel how she overcomes it. Otherwise, the singer, who took a break from the limelight in 2013, is no longer hiding. In April she came out in a podcast as queer. \"Friday\" has reached a total of almost 300 million views to date, although it temporarily disappeared from the internet due to legal disputes between Black's family and ARK Music Factory. This is comparatively little by today's standards, \"Gangnam Style\" broke the billion-view mark a year later. But in 2011 \"Friday\" was the most viewed video on YouTube and was the forerunner of many viral music videos. In the short time the song also set a negative record: With three million dislikes - thumbs down - \"Friday\" became the most hated video on YouTube. The hatred was not limited to the comment section. Black then received several death threats. \"When so many people keep telling you you're a joke or that you're stupid for following your dream, at 13 you have no choice but to believe it,\" Black said looking back. The musician no longer wants to be defined by the meme she was made into as a teenager. \"I have to remember every day to overcome the insecurities that have existed since my youth,\" she says. This process takes place on social media, but also in newer songs like \"Self-Sabotage\". She no longer leaves their texts to her producers alone. Black has never had another hit like \"Friday\". Nevertheless, she still has millions of followers on Twitter, Instagram and YouTube. At the moment, she is not using this range to promote her new single, but rather retweeted activists from the Black Lives Matter movement. \"There will always be time to talk about yourself,\" Black explains, \"but this is not the time for selfies right now.\" Her reach on social media fell to her without being asked. So she deals with her all the more carefully: \"As someone with such a large, young audience, I have a responsibility.\" Hate and agitation with often inhuman or racist content are common in social networks and forums. How to deal with personal attacks? And what do platform operators and legislators do? Current content, recommendations and links on hate speech and cyberbullying can be found at SPIEGELed. Black, born in 1997, describes herself as a child of the Internet. Even before she became part of the network culture herself, she was there more than in the real world looking for belonging. \"The internet gives me the opportunity to learn and hear other people's stories,\" she says. What happened to Rebecca Black almost ten years ago is no longer so unusual on social media. Anyone can become the star of a viral video on platforms like TikTok. More than half of TikTok users are under the age of 24. In the past, the platform was repeatedly criticized for its inadequate protection of minors. \"Going viral feels so much different today when it happens millions of times a day,\" says Black. Stories like yours have become almost everyday today. She jokes that she would like to be there for all the children and young people whose Internet fame goes hand in hand with hate comments. Instead, she can only hope that a family will also support them. In retrospect, despite the wave of hate on the Internet, she does not wish to undo \"Friday\". \"Who knows what I would be like today without this learning process,\" she says. After 2011 she found hold in different communities online and offline, meanwhile she is a role model for many of her fans. \"Nice words and photos look empty so quickly,\" she says of her decision to address bullying and its consequences. \"I just wanted to be honest about my feelings.\" Black's openness did not bring her new hatred this year, but rather respect. And even the comments under the video from \"Friday\" have changed. Some people still compare the song to torture. But even more comments are happy that Rebecca Black has not turned her back on the Internet - even if she had every reason for it.\n",

She is standing in her house in the North Rhine-Westphalian town of Porta Westfalica and is looking at the lawn, where, in the corner next to the lilac bush, he should see his own pool. \"It should be a real oasis of wellbeing\".

            " The two horses go through, the carriage collides with a car, tips over and a 78-year-old dies: Around two years after a fatal carriage accident at the Ohlsdorf cemetery in Hamburg, the district court acquitted the former owner of the horse-drawn carriage business. The 56-year-old defendant did not violate her duty of care and was therefore not guilty of negligent homicide or bodily harm, said judge Björn Jönsson. \"It was a tragedy.\" The prosecutor had ordered a fine of 100 daily rates of 15 euros, the defense lawyers had pleaded for acquittal. The accused had offered horse-drawn carriage rides across the extensive park cemetery. At a stop before a second tour on September 26, 2018, the horses had gone through when two passengers were already sitting in the carriage and two others were standing on the running board. The horses pulled the vehicle onto the central traffic axis of the cemetery. There it crashed into a car. The carriage overturned, two older women were pinched under the car. A 78-year-old died and an 80-year-old was seriously injured. The other two passengers and the 50-year-old driver also suffered injuries. One of the horses had to be put to sleep. Around 100 tours of the accused had previously gone without incident. \"Horses are refugees, you have to reckon with everything,\" said one expert. A team leader should therefore sit on the coach frame before the first passenger gets in. Because the horses could only be steered by the reins on their mouths. In the judgment, the court stated: \"The carriage was anything but abandoned.\" The assistant stood in front of the horses and held them. The defendant said in her last word how sorry she was for the fatal accident. The horse-drawn carriage business has long since given up, the surviving horse stands on a pasture as a therapy horse. \"My life dream has turned into a nightmare,\" said the 56-year-old.\n",

The pilot of a light aircraft then commented on the gesture in an impossible way: his plane pulled a banner with the racist inscription \"White Lives Matter - Burnley\" over the Etihad Stadium. \"Damn shit, an absolute shame,\" the English journalist Sam Lee tweeted under a photo of the banner. Other Twitter users also commented how much they were ashamed of the action. According to English media reports, the plane flew over the stadium with the banner immediately after the declaration of solidarity. Burnley specifically condemned the action during the game. \"We want to make it clear that these people are not welcome with us. This is not what Burnley Football Club stands for, and we will work closely with the authorities to identify those responsible and issue lifelong bans,\" said the club in a statement with. \"I'm ashamed and embarrassed,\" said Burnley's Ben Mee after the game. Burnley is fully behind the Premier League's \"Black Lives Matter\" initiative: \"We wholeheartedly apologize to the Premier League, Manchester City and everyone who helps promote Black Lives Matter.\" The slogan \"Black Lives Matter\" also appears on the jerseys of all Premier League teams and replaces the player names. Hundreds of thousands of people worldwide have been protesting racism since the violent death of black American George Floyd after police violence. At first, it was not known who organized the plane and the banner.\n",

Through floor-to-ceiling windows she looks at the pastures of her stud in the Oldenburger Münsterland. They are green even at the beginning of spring. Together with her husband Frank, she keeps around 60 horses here. A \"small but fine breed\" says their website. This is politely understated, because Arns-Krogmann owns gold, one of the most valuable dressage horses in the world.

As the paper wrote, the 74-year-old noticed the loss on Tuesday night at around 3 a.m. when he was about to take the car for a spin. The police confirmed the theft of a rare Porsche 911 R, but did not want to comment on the owner when asked. The criminal police are investigating the case, it said.

            " The British government wants to make it difficult for foreign investors to take over important domestic companies in certain cases. Corresponding legislative changes would therefore be introduced on Monday. This is intended to enable the government to intervene in the health sector, for example, should a takeover endanger the fight against crises such as the current corona pandemic. The government is ready to act \"when it is necessary to protect our national security,\" said Economics Minister Alok Sharma. Britain is \"open to investments, but not to exploitation\". The government is already empowered to scrutinize acquisitions, including for reasons of national security or financial stability. It can block an investment or obtain assurances from a buyer about its plans. In the future, however, the government can also take action, for example, at pharmaceutical companies. Other countries have also responded to make it more difficult for companies to sell out as a result of the corona crisis. Due to the pandemic, the federal government changed its plans to review acquisitions from non-EU countries more closely. For example, it wants to take a closer look at investments in the health sector: If Chinese investors want to buy a ventilator manufacturer on a larger scale, for example, the state could more easily veto it in the future.\n",

            " With an increasing disposable mentality, recycling companies are asking the textile industry to take more responsibility for their products. \"The previously free high-quality system for recycling used textiles is on the verge of collapse,\" warned the Vice President of the Federal Association of Secondary Raw Materials and Disposal, Martin Wittmann. \"Fast fashion\", ie short-lived cheap fashion, and the strains of the corona crisis made economic collection and recycling impossible. Although the quantity collected has increased in recent years - by around 300,000 tonnes from 2013 to 2018 - the recyclers could not benefit from this. This is due to the fact that the quality has decreased significantly: Many things cannot be used or contain harmful chemical fibers. In the industry, it is assumed that this trend will continue and will be reinforced by Corona - and therefore raises the alarm. The textile industry has to consider the later product cycle with its products, says Wittmann. \"Clothing made from cheap chemical fibers or even fiber mixes are neither suitable as second-hand goods, nor for further use.\" Politics is also in demand.\n",

The police cannot accept this, as the roads for emergency vehicles must remain clear. \"Since this is a publicly accessible forest, we have to be able to patrol there,\" said the police spokesman.

They come from a broader political spectrum, including those from the anarchist and the environmental scene. The forest at the Hambach opencast mine between Cologne and Aachen was originally to be cleared for the progressive opencast mine. The forest developed into a symbol for the fight of climate protectors against the coal industry. In one of the largest police operations in North Rhine-Westphalian history, the Hambacher Forest was cleared in autumn 2018. 86 tree houses were destroyed. NRW Interior Minister Herbert Reul (CDU) argued that there should be no legal space. Finally, the federal government, the states and the energy companies agreed at the beginning of this year in the course of the coal agreement that the forest should be preserved. The activists of the anti-coal alliance \"Ende Terrain\" described this as a success of civil disobedience. However, they refused to withdraw from the forest.\n",

            " A fateful week begins for the future of Lufthansa, which should culminate with the extraordinary general meeting on Thursday. But even at the beginning of the week there is bad news about Germany's largest airline. After the share price crashed in the corona crisis, the paper can only be found in the MDax from today on. After almost 32 years of membership in the leading German index Dax, Lufthansa had to vacate its place for the Berlin real estate group Deutsche Wohnen. Most recently, the industrial group Thyssenkrupp had to leave the highest stock exchange league in September 2019. This is just one of many problems for the future of the company, which relies on the granting of billions of dollars in government aid. In order to keep costs down in the group, Lufthansa is currently negotiating a comprehensive savings package that will be presented to shareholders on Thursday. The airline spoke of a mathematical surplus of 22,000 full-time positions, half of them in Germany. Negotiations about job cuts with the unions are expected to bring results today, the pilots had already offered the company to forego up to 45 percent of their salary in order to save the jobs. In order to at least save the families of the employees from insecurities in this tense situation, the company has moved the payment of June salaries to today's Monday, according to the \"Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung\", in order to guarantee an \"undisturbed salary payment course\" in this turbulent time. In the end, the austerity program could bring little if the agreement on the nine billion euros in government aid bursts. And this agreement reached after weeks of negotiations is on the brink. Because major shareholder Heinz Hermann Thiele is critical of the federal government's 20% stake in Lufthansa - and has expanded its stake in the past few weeks. Thiele has left his approval of the aid at the Annual General Meeting on Thursday open. Since only a few shareholders have registered for the meeting, it will be particularly difficult. \"We have known since tonight that our shareholders have registered less than 38 percent of the capital for this Annual General Meeting,\" said a letter from Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr to the employees on Sunday. So it is clear \"that a two-thirds majority must be reached in the vote.\" And the group no longer believes in this: Approval does not appear \"according to the latest statements by important shareholders, particularly on the terms of the capital increase,\" Spohr writes. In view of this complicated situation, Federal Minister of Finance Olaf Scholz (SPD) invited major shareholder Thiele and CEO Spohr to a crisis meeting for a report today. The participation of Federal Minister of Economics Peter Altmaier is also planned, reported the Reuters news agency, citing an insider. There is no official confirmation of the meeting at the ministry, which \"Bild am Sonntag\" also reported. In an employee letter, Lufthansa CEO Spohr had emphasized that the airline will continue to maintain \"close exchanges and constant dialog with the federal government and the largest shareholders\" this weekend and in the coming days. In return for state aid, Lufthansa is also supposed to hand over 24 take-off and landing rights at its important airports in Frankfurt and Munich. The group, which employs 138,000 people, expects that the recovery in air traffic demand will be slow. Currently only a small part of the Lufthansa fleet takes off to travel destinations. In the first quarter, the corona crisis brought the group a loss of 2.1 billion euros; the cash reserves are rapidly disappearing. \"According to our current assumptions about the course of business over the next three years, at Lufthansa alone we have no prospect of employment for every seventh pilot and every sixth flight attendant, as well as numerous employees on the ground,\" said HR Director Michael Niggemann recently. However, Lufthansa wants to keep as many employees as possible and avoid redundancies. Nevertheless, Lufthansa is afraid of a defeat or even an insolvency solution. \"In the event that the general meeting does not approve the federal stabilization measures, we have made extensive preparations, among other things, to prevent grounding,\" Spohr wrote in the employee letter. \"We would also use the remaining time before filing for bankruptcy to discuss options with the federal government.\"\n",

            " at least the moon landing for comparison, it has to be, said Helge Braun. Using the new Corona app is \"a small step for all of us, but a big step for fighting pandemics,\" the Chancellor's Office said in Berlin on Tuesday. The federal government can rightly celebrate a little, because the app is finally available, that's good news. It was talked about long enough. But this week the impression is growing that there is one factor driving the pandemic that even the best app can't help: poverty. In the past few days, several hundred employees of the Tönnies slaughterhouse in North Rhine-Westphalia have tested positive. The cases made the district of Gütersloh a focus of infection, schools and daycare centers closed immediately. The Tönnies outbreak has a social aspect: many workers in the meat factories live in narrow quarters in collective accommodation, often they have to share bathrooms and toilets, wages are poor, working conditions are tough. There have also been increased new infections in Berlin recently. In the Neukölln district, an entire block of flats was quarantined, which is mainly inhabited by poor people, and there were also outbreaks in the Reinickendorf district. Patrick Larscheid, the head of the local health department, feels hypocritical that everyone is now praising the warning app, because it is nothing more than a toy for the digital upper class. \"Medicine, once again, is also political: These people get sick again and again because they live the way they live - in poor conditions,\" says Larscheid. In other countries with more infected and dead people, it is even clearer that income and ethnicity have a say in who gets Covid-19 - and who doesn't survive, report my colleagues Jan Friedmann and Matthias Bartsch. In the United States, nearly two and a half times more Afro-Americans died of Covid-19 than whites in terms of population, and six times as many in the capital Washington, with a high proportion of Afro-Americans. The hotspots include poorer cities such as Detroit and New Orleans, where the majority of black people live. In the UK, the virus killed many caregivers and nurses of Asian descent. The virus, it was often said, did not care about national borders and the social position of individuals, it affected everyone equally. A fallacy. The German doctor Rudolf Virchow, who campaigned for basic medical care for the population, wrote in 1848: \"Medicine is a social science, and politics is nothing more than medicine in general.\" This should be remembered occasionally. \"Holidays forever - because of regular operations: why the school chaos continues\" is the title of the new SPIEGEL.

            " \"Many single-use plastic products are superfluous and no sustainable use of resources,\" said Environment Minister Svenja Schulze (SPD). All too often, plastics ended up in the environment or the oceans. \"If global littering continues like this, we'll have more plastic than fish in our oceans by 2050.\" The ban will lead to better and environmentally friendly products. \"In particular, reusable is the means of choice from an environmental perspective.\" At the end of 2018, the decision was taken in Brussels to ban single-use plastic products in the European Union for which there are good alternatives from summer 2021. This applies to cotton swabs, plastic cutlery and plates, straws, stirring sticks for coffee, balloon sticks and styrofoam cups and containers for takeaway food. In addition, the ban applies to products made of plastics that decompose into tiny parts through a reaction with oxygen - called oxidation. In the corona crisis, waste disposal companies had recently reported an overall increase in waste quantities - for fear of the virus, disposable items are therefore used more often. From July 3, 2021, it will now be an administrative offense to sell plastic cutlery, for example. In the future, alternatives could be, for example, wooden forks at snack bars or drinking straws made of glass, stable plastic or other materials that can be used repeatedly at garden parties. Cotton swabs have long been available in the drugstore with a paper stick. The products that are banned accounted for about a tenth of the volume of waste on streets and in public trash bins in local authorities, in some cases even up to a fifth, said Vice President of the Association of Municipal Enterprises (VKU), Patrick Hasenkamp. When it comes to implementing the EU directive, the devil is in the details: one-way plastic should not simply be replaced by one-way products made of another material or one-way products should be declared as \"reusable\". German environmental aid is also not satisfied. Environment Minister Schulze only wants to implement minimum requirements of the EU, said waste expert Thomas Fischer. \"This is ambitious and does not do justice to Germany's role as a driving force within the European Union.\" An extension of the ban to all disposable beverage cups and food boxes made of plastic would be just as necessary as binding reusable funding and a clear demarcation of disposable and reusable products. Incidentally, the planned ban on plastic bags at the cash register is another construction site and has nothing to do with the EU regulation. The cabinet had already banned the bag at the end of 2019 - the bill is in the parliamentary procedure - and was already a topic in the environmental committee of the Bundestag. The EU ban targets plastic articles that, according to the Commission, are found particularly often on the beaches of the Member States. According to the Federal Environment Agency, the German coasts are also polluted. Last year, the agency said 390 pieces of garbage were found per hundred meters on the North Sea and 70 on the Baltic Sea - the majority of which were plastic.\n",

            " In the middle of the fight against the corona pandemic, Mexico was hit by a severe earthquake. The 7.5 magnitude quake shook the south and center of the country on Tuesday. At least six people were killed, dozens more were injured, officials said. People ran into the streets in panic, office and apartment buildings swayed. More than 500 buildings have been damaged, including 15 health centers, four schools and four archaeological sites. The center of the quake was according to the National Seismological Institute in Crucecita in the southern state of Oaxaca. The small town on the Pacific coast is a popular destination for vacationers. All six fatalities died near Crucecita. Most of them were killed by falling parts of the building. A worker from the state-owned oil company Pemex was killed when he fell from a plant in the Salina Cruz refinery. A fire broke out there shortly after the quake. The fire was quickly extinguished, Pemex said. The tremors were also felt in the capital Mexico City, 700 kilometers away. According to Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum, the earthquake alarm sounded there for about a minute in the morning before the vibrations were felt. Numerous people left their homes and took to safety. Around 30 buildings were slightly damaged, as Sheinbaum said. Cracks in facades and broken window panes were reported. A hospital was evacuated. In many places there was also a power cut in the capital. A man piles up debris in Oaxaca, Mexico In September 2017, 369 people were killed in a similarly strong earthquake, 228 of them in Mexico City. At that time, the epicenter was much closer to the capital. The disaster occurred exactly 32 years to the day after the strongest earthquake in recent history, when at least 10,000 people died in Mexico City in 1985 in a 8.1 magnitude quake. In the current quake, the US authorities initially issued a tsunami warning for parts of the Mexican, Central and South American Pacific coast and the US state of Hawaii. After a few hours, the US tsunami warning center in the Pacific canceled the warning. According to President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, no essential infrastructure such as ports, airports, refineries or hydropower plants has been damaged. The quake was also felt in the states of Guerrero, Veracruz, Puebla and Chiapas. Obrador called on the population to remain calm and prepare for possible aftershocks. The seismological service reported more than 650 aftershocks with a magnitude of up to 4.9. Mexico is also currently struggling with the corona pandemic. On Tuesday, a record increase in new infections by 6288 was recorded within 24 hours - the highest number since the first known pathogen in the country. In total, around 191,400 cases of infection were counted in Mexico. The official death toll was 23,377. After Brazil, Mexico is the country most affected by the pandemic in Latin America. The treatment of Covid-19 and other diseases is still guaranteed in all hospitals, even after the quake.\n",

            " The activist collective Distributed Denial of Secrets (DDoS) has released hundreds of thousands of internal documents from various U.S. police agencies, including the FBI. The BlueLeaks collection contains 269 gigabytes of data from 24 years and is searchable online. The latest documents are from June 2020 and, according to Forbes, are related to the protests against police violence. The police reports and documents include names, email addresses, emails and attachments, telephone numbers, photos and videos as well as PDF, ZIP and CSV files. Even suspect account details are included in the BlueLeaks, journalist Brian Krebs reports. They appear to be from a compromised Texas service provider called Netsential. This in turn is used by so-called fusion centers, which are state institutions for the exchange of police and intelligence information. BlueLeaks on the Internet Cancer asked former senior NSA and DHS lawyer Stewart Baker about the possible effects. Baker said the documents were unlikely to reveal previously unknown cases of police violence: \"This is not the kind of work that happens in the Fusion Centers.\" But Baker believes that the release won't go without consequences. On the one hand, given the amount of data, it cannot be ruled out that there are references to informants and undercover agents, which could endanger their lives. On the other hand, the data could also help criminals: \"Every group of organized crime in the country will likely have searched the files for their own names before law enforcement officers knew what was included, so the damage could be done quickly.\" How the data ended up with Distributed Denial of Secrets is unclear. The National Fusion Center Association and Netsential assume that someone used Netsential access to upload malware into the system, which in turn caused the data to be diverted. But whether the Netsential account itself was hacked or used by a legitimate user is not clear from their answers. The Distributed Denial of Secrets group - sometimes referred to as \"Alternative WikiLeaks\" - the abbreviation DDoS alludes to distributed congestion attacks on servers called Distributed Denial of Service - presents itself as impartial. It emphasizes that it also publishes hacked data, it but never to procure by yourself. SPIEGEL has also already worked with DDoS. The collective had handed over a large data set from the business register to a well-known tax haven, the Bahamas. It contained documents on prominent Germans such as Uwe Seeler.

            " It is a small gesture to heal injuries: Band-Aid, an American manufacturer of bandages, has announced that it will also be offering its patches in shades of brown and black skin in the future. The new colors beyond flesh pink should \"capture the beauty of diverse skin,\" said the daughter of cosmetics giant Johnson & Johnson on Instagram. Band-Aid also promised a donation for the \"Black Lives Matter\" movement: \"We promise that this is only the first of many common steps in the fight against structural racism.\" Like Band-Aid, countless US companies are currently trying to get involved in the racism debate. Not everyone succeeds without a break: Starbucks of all people, which sees itself as a particularly social company and, after ejecting two black people from a branch in 2008, threw almost 200,000 employees into a one-day \"awareness training\" against discrimination, has now stumbled. A storm of indignation broke out on Twitter because the company had prohibited its personnel from expressing sympathy with the \"Black Lives Matter\" movement. It only took a few hours for the company to give way. Now he is distributing 250,000 specially designed T-shirts nationwide to his barista, on which a clenched fist is emblazoned. Alexis Ohanian and Serena Williams. In contrast, the founding of the founder of the fitness chain CrossFit, Greg Glassman, came too late. After Glassman said at a zoom meeting with operators of his muckibuden that he saw no reason to mourn George Floyd, who was killed by police violence, many gyms fled. Reebok also cut its nine-year relationship with CrossFit. Glassman has made CrossFit one of the largest fitness empires in the United States in over two decades.

            " Three and a half weeks after the protests against police violence, racism and discrimination began, the movement has achieved a number of such small successes: Walmart plans to forego storing African-American beauty products in closed showcases for fear of shoplifting. The luxury cosmetics chain Sephora promises to save 15 percent of the shelf space for products from black entrepreneurs. The co-founder of social news aggregator Reddit, Alexis Ohanian, sent a personal signal: the internet entrepreneur, who is married to tennis player Serena Williams, stepped down from the board so that his post could be filled with a black candidate. The food company Pepsi, known in Germany primarily for its lemonades, wants to change the presentation of its \"Aunt Jemima\" brand, under which baking mixes, breakfast pancakes and syrups are sold. The origins of the brand, which is over 130 years old, were based on race stereotypes, it says. The Mars group also wants to revise the logo of its rice brand \"Uncle Ben's\". Like \"Aunt Jemima\", the black advertising character \"Uncle Ben\" has a racist undertone. The multi-billion dollar entertainment industry has also recognized the signs of the times: Cable provider Paramount Network stopped the reality show \"Cops\" shortly before the start of season 33 - a series that has not been very successful but has been running for 30 years, in which \"the predominantly white police forces the good guys are; the villains are mostly black \", as a TV critic of the broadcaster Fox wrote at the premiere. ABC chose 28-year-old Matt James, who was actually only supposed to be a candidate for the \"Bachelorette\", to be the next \"Bachelor\" - the first African-American dream man since the show was launched. \"There is never a wrong time to do the right thing,\" the North Carolina real estate agent commented dryly on the promotion to the star. Meanwhile, Fox News, where presenter Tucker Carlson makes his right sayings, is running advertisers away. T-Mobile said on Twitter that the company hadn't run ads on the Tonight show for weeks, \"and we canceled all future placements.\" \"Bye-bye, Tucker Carlson!\", CEO Mike Sievert replied.

            " There is great hope that such PR-effective solidarity actions will bring about real social change that will give African Americans equal opportunities for career and prosperity. But the road is long, admits the CEO of ice cream maker Ben & Jerry's, Matthew McCarthy. Ben & Jerry's, now part of the Unilever group, is considered a credible advocate of the anti-discrimination movement because it didn't discover the issue yesterday. Still, the ice chain is \"a very white company,\" McCarthy said self-critically at CNN: \"We have to ask ourselves, why are we such a white company?\" The CEO sees companies, not just politics, as a duty. Without clear and quantifiable targets, nothing will change, he warns. In the business world, the following applies: \"You value what you measure. You measure what you value.\" Ben & Jerry's CEO Matthew McCarthy. However, most companies do not want to go that far. Instead, they promise money: Fortune 100 companies have pledged $ 1.6 billion to fight discrimination since the death of Floyd, according to the Axios news portal - 0.2 percent of their profits in 2019. That was \"impressive,\" but only a \"down payment on progress,\" said Andre Perry of the Brookings Institution think tank. \"What I miss is a strategy behind the donations.\" The symbol counts for the time being. Band-Aid has received praise for expanding its range, but many have asked: Why only now? In fact, in 2005 the brand launched a product for non-white skin tones. \"Due to a lack of interest at the time,\" the \"Perfect Blend\" line was discontinued, the company said.

            " The police have removed several structures on paths in the forest during a major operation in the Hambacher Forest. The goal of the action was basically achieved, said a police spokesman on Tuesday. The paths through the forest would have to be kept clear, otherwise it would no longer be passable for patrol or ambulance vehicles. According to the information, several hundreds were in use. Coal opponents condemned the action as an unnecessary provocation, the barricades did not pose a danger to anyone. The police reported some minor incidents. Two women who had not complied with \"repeated expulsions\" were detained. \"A woman resisted her identity check and tried to bite a policeman. The officer was not injured,\" the police said. On the way to the guard, they also both contaminated the police transport vehicle. As a spokeswoman said, the police assume that it was excrement. Several disguised people had thrown stones and wood at two police vehicles while driving. \"In addition, unknown employees from RWE threw guns at them.\" Nobody was injured and property damage occurred to the vehicles. According to the police, RWE employees were involved in the campaign because the officials themselves did not have the vehicles and equipment to dismantle the wooden structures in the forest. The services of the group would be charged to the authority. Activists and the police: Small incidents Marius Becker / dpa The anti-coal alliance \"Endegebiet\" criticized the police operation. \"This looks like a typical case of police harassment,\" spokeswoman Ronja Weil said. \"We show solidarity with the occupiers\". Even if the preservation of the forest had been agreed as part of the coal compromise, its future remained in jeopardy. \"End of terrain\" is not involved in the occupation of the forest, but supports the forest dwellers.

            " In 2018, the forest had become a symbol of the struggle between climate protectionists and the coal industry. The police had emphasized from the beginning that it was not a question of clearing tree houses. Forest occupants would have built structures of tree trunks with platforms up to 15 meters high on the forest paths. The police could not accept this because the roads for emergency vehicles would have to remain clear. Police said several barricades were removed. Scattered \"crow's feet\" and nail boards were also collected. The officials said they discovered a small memorial to the violently killed black American George Floyd along a path. However, this could have stopped because it was not an obstacle. Demolition campaign in the Hambacher Forest Marius Becker / dpa The Hambacher Forest was originally intended to be cleared for the lignite opencast mine. The forest was cleared in autumn 2018 in one of the largest police operations in North Rhine-Westphalian history. 86 tree houses were destroyed. Finally, the federal government, the federal states and energy companies agreed at the beginning of this year in the course of the coal agreement that the forest should still be preserved. Activists continue to live in the forest. According to the police, the number fluctuates greatly, it should be about a hundred people. They come from a broad political spectrum, including those from the anarchist and the environmental scene. The forest occupants have built around a hundred new tree houses.\n",

            " Last Sunday, Donald Trump's campaign manager presented record numbers. Brad Parscale wrote on Twitter that 800,000 tickets had already been requested for Trump's campaign event in Tulsa, Oklahoma. He spoke of by far the greatest demand for Trump rallies so far, according to Parscale on Monday there were already over a million inquiries. The pictures, which penetrated from the arena onto television, the web and all over the world on Saturday evening, did not match these announcements at all: A considerable part of the almost 20,000-seat arena had remained empty - despite all the alleged crowds. According to \"Forbes\", the Tulsa fire department spoke of just under 6,200 visitors. And Trump's appearance outside the hall was also canceled at short notice, presumably because there was hardly any audience for it. A disgrace, especially in view of the Trump team's boast. But what was the reason for the obviously overestimated interest in the appearance? Was Trump fans ultimately afraid of being infected with the corona virus at a mass event? Did ticket buyers fear protesters who took to the streets in the vicinity of the event, as theories circulating on Twitter suggest, the spread of which sparked Brad Parscale with several retweets? Or maybe one or the other interested party was worried about not even getting into the arena with such a rush? After all, no fixed seats could be booked in advance, the principle was \"first come, first served\". Ultimately, various factors may have played a role - including one that Trump's campaign team would probably not like at all: A lot of young Americans could have booked tickets to the event in order not to go there consciously. Social media expert Sarah Frier, who recently published a well-respected book on Instagram with \"No Filter\", reports about such plans online. Various videos show that there were actually calls in apps like TikTok to register for the event and then stay away as a protest against the president. The clip that got everything rolling should come from Mary Jo Laupp, who calls herself \"TikTok-Grandma\". Your call, which outlined the idea of ​​a \"No Show\" protest the Friday before last, has now reached two million hits. Other videos on the topic, which come primarily from young users, do not all have such high clicks. In addition to the clips, there are often approving comments that indicate that the campaign is being disseminated far beyond individual videos. \"Oh my god, I just registered for Trump's rally - and I'm so excited not to go there,\" said a TikToker named \"emilysdcp\" a week ago. Her video has been viewed 37,000 times since then. Various other TikTok accounts also posted confirmations of ticket orders. Some danced \"Macarena\", others made funny excuses for not staying. For example, a young woman said that she had to go for a walk with her gecko on the day she asked for places. Sarah Frier comments on such clips on Twitter that there has been a \"tremendous viral effort\" on the Internet, although it is difficult to say exactly how great the impact of social media campaigns on the number of visitors was in the end. In a Bloomberg article by the author, the actions had taken place on TikTok, Instagram and Twitter in the past few days, and teenagers in particular had been hit, especially fans of Korean pop music. That K-pop scene had recently made headlines with political campaigns, such as the US protests against racism and police violence after George Floyd's death. For example, the hashtag #WhiteLivesMatter, with which right-wing activists wanted to point out alleged discrimination against white people, was flooded with K-pop videos to slow down the right-wing campaign. Some channels of the Anonymous network movement were also involved. Technically, it was also straightforward at the Trump event to influence what was happening from your home smartphone. The website for the event only asked for the name, email address, mobile phone number, zip code and state. Since a confirmation code came via SMS, but the other data was presumably not checked in detail, all that was required to register was basically a functioning mobile phone number. Admission was not required for the event. There were several postings online online by parents on Sunday morning in Germany reporting that their children and their friends had participated in the online campaigns - including Steve Schmidt, who was once responsible for Republican John McCain's campaign for the 2008 US presidential election. Meanwhile, comedian and rapper Elijah Daniel, who has around 700,000 followers on Twitter, claimed that he alone had requested 20 tickets - after which many other Twitter users said they had registered many times. Daniel, himself born in 1994, had already described \"Generation Z\" (meaning people who were born between 1997 and 2012) a week ago as \"damn funny and unscrupulous\": it would have the president and the conservative media played a prank by pretending that a million people would take part in the rally, Daniel tweeted at that time. The \"New York Times\" also explained to Elijah Daniel that many users who drummed online for the campaign had deleted their videos within 24 hours so that the Trump campaign was not aware of the plans. \"These kids are smart and have thought of everything.\" For Donald Trump's political competition, the references to an action by young people, combined with the pictures from Tulsa, are now a steep template. For example, the democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted to campaign manager Parscale, teenagers on TikTok had tricked the Trump team: They thought that a million people wanted to fill an arena because of a \"White Supremacist Open Mic\" - and that during the Corona crisis.\n",

            " It is cold and noisy in the halls, the work is strenuous: The new corona virus apparently feels as comfortable in only a few places as in meat companies. The trail leads primarily to the division, where slaughtered animals are broken down into their individual parts in a chord. Almost all of the 1553 employees of the Tönnies meat factory in Gütersloh, who tested positive, work there. The precarious employment contracts quickly came under suspicion of having favored the outbreak because they force the employees into cramped living conditions. According to reports, ten Tönnies employees share a three-room apartment. But the meat factories themselves apparently fuel the pandemic. In the United States alone, 14,000 corona infections can be attributed to outbreaks in 181 meat factories, and at least 54 of those affected died. There have also been major outbreaks in the UK and France. According to an analysis by scientists from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, meat factories are the biggest drivers of the pandemic, along with ships and mass accommodation. Three factors seem to play a role in the spread: The halls in which the animals are broken down have cooled down. Actually, this is supposed to prevent the meat from germinating, but the new corona virus apparently doesn't make much of a difference, on the contrary. At temperatures around four degrees, the viruses roamed for a particularly long time in nasal and pharyngeal secretions, studies by the US disease control agency CDC show. In addition, the genes of the viruses could be detected on surfaces at single-digit temperatures for up to seven days - seven times longer than at normal room temperatures. This does not mean that you can be infected through contaminated areas for such a long period of time, but apparently the virus endures low temperatures much better than high ones. There is also often noise in the halls. The employees must therefore speak to each other loudly or even shout. Studies have shown that a particularly large number of breath droplets are thrown into the air. Due to the hard work, the employees also breathe harder, also a risk of infection. In enclosed spaces, aerosols are likely to form more easily - tiny droplets that may remain in the air for hours and can contain infectious viruses. Even a safety distance of two meters might not be enough to prevent infection. The Robert Koch Institute also suspects that the outbreaks in meat factories are due to several factors. On the one hand, a reason should be sought in the cramped living conditions, said RKI boss Lothar Wieler. The low temperatures and the easier formation of the aerosols also played a role: \"Both will probably contribute to this.\" Tönnies is not the first meat corona hotspot in North Rhine-Westphalia. In mid-May, at least 260 employees at Westfleisch in Coesfeld tested positive for the coronavirus. The circle had to postpone the planned easing by a week. The state government then put all meat plants under general suspicion. All 18,271 employees in the meat industry in North Rhine-Westphalia were tested, 418 of them were demonstrably infected with the coronavirus, the state health ministry informed SPIEGEL. Seven of them worked at Tönnies. The group then carried out its own tests to detect infections. Why the outbreak remained undetected is unclear. In addition, the state government ordered controls in all companies in the meat industry. Tönnies was among them, the responsible department for occupational safety and health in Detmold said on request. During controls between May 11 and 18, it was noticed that Tönnies violated its own hygiene concept. For example, employees in production had not kept their distance, the cafeteria was too close and not every employee was wearing his or her nose and nose protection correctly. During a follow-up inspection on May 29, however, all requirements were met. The fact that the outbreak, which is now forcing the first district in Germany to lockdown again, could not be prevented, despite all the security measures. Meat factories have long not only been in North Rhine-Westphalia. At Müller Fleisch in Birkenfeld in Baden-Württemberg, more than a third of the workforce had tested positive for the corona virus in May, around 400 people were affected. Whether the local outbreak at Tönnies grows into a second wave depends on how well the infection chains can be understood. Prime Minister Laschet still assumes that the virus has not been spread to the general population by the meat factory. The renewed lockdown is therefore a precaution. If the planned mass tests nevertheless show that people who have not had direct contact with the Tönnies Group have also contracted the lockdown, the lockdown would probably have to last much longer than the seven days initially estimated.

            " China has completed its satellite-based \"Beidou\" navigation network. With the launch of the last satellite, the global system was completed. At the head of a Long March 3B rocket, the satellite launched from Xichang Spaceport in southwest China and reached Earth's orbit. Beidou-3, which uses 35 satellites, competes with other navigation systems: the European Galileo, the Russian system Glonass - but especially also the American GPS. With Beidou-1 and Beidou-2, China has so far only been able to provide seamless coverage in the Asia-Pacific region. The last Beidou satellite was originally scheduled to be launched on June 16. The start had to be postponed due to technical problems. China is pursuing an ambitious space program. The Chinese’s first unmanned mission to Mars is due to start in the summer. Another unmanned flight to the moon is planned for the end of this year. For the first time in the history of the Chinese space program, Chang'e is said to bring back 5 rock samples from the Earth's satellite.

            " The corona outbreak at Germany's largest meat producer Tönnies in North Rhine-Westphalia threatens to get out of control. In view of the sometimes violent outbreaks and accompanying cuts in everyday life, the German Association of Cities and Towns now warns of possible social conflicts. \"We must not discriminate or discriminate against people who, for example, have ensured cheap meat production in certain establishments in the low-wage sector under poor living conditions,\" said managing director Gerd Landsberg to the newspapers of the Funke media group. He emphasized that people living in cramped conditions should not be blamed because infections are more likely to occur there. In particular, companies are required to ensure decent wages and working conditions, but in particular also for living conditions in which adequate hygiene standards can be guaranteed. At Tönnies in Rheda-Wiedenbrück, East Westphalia, more than 1,300 people have already tested positive for the virus. The entire workforce is currently in quarantine. General exit restrictions for the Gütersloh district are not excluded. The federal government expressed concern about the \"massive outbreak\". They rely on comprehensive measures on site to limit the spread of infections, said government spokesman Steffen Seibert. There is a high risk of infection for the region. The SPD health expert Karl Lauterbach warns of the free travel of people from the region. \"I am sure that significantly more people outside of the workforce are now infected,\" said Lauterbach of the \"Rheinische Post\". The virus could potentially spread very widely, said the studied epidemiologist. According to the NGG union, some employees may have already returned to their home countries. \"It can be assumed that some will travel,\" said NGG country chairman Mohamed Boudih. Not all employees with around 7,000 employees had received the written quarantine request. The slaughterhouse also employs people from Romania, Bulgaria and Poland. A county spokesman said there were verbal requests to employees to quarantine. In addition, the district had issued a general decree that all persons working on the company premises and people who live in shared accommodation must go into quarantine at home by July 2. It was said: \"During this time, these people are prohibited from leaving their accommodations or other dwellings without the express consent of the Health Department.\" Federal Minister of Labor Hubertus Heil announced that the company might be liable for the consequences of the Corona outbreak. \"I believe that we have to examine the civil liability options in this area,\" said the SPD politician in the ARD \"Morgenmagazin\". There would be considerable costs for the health treatment of people, \"but also for what is going on in the region\". The company had to do everything possible to limit the damage and to vouch for \"what was done there\". It is essentially about the concept of responsibility.

            " The result was encouraging for the researchers at the University of Oxford: together with scientists from the US National Institutes of Health, they tested the Sars CoV-2 vaccine \"ChAdOx1 nCoV-19\" on six monkeys. With this vaccine, the genetic information of the virus is infiltrated into the cells with the help of a so-called vector, in this case a harmless cold virus - a principle that was successful in the development of an Ebola vaccine. Stephan Becker, Director of the Institute of Virology at the Philipps University in Marburg. All animals produced so-called neutralizing antibodies against the novel corona virus. These are an important marker for the fact that vaccination protection develops. But disappointment soon followed. When the researchers subsequently brought the monkeys into contact with Sars-CoV-2, it became clear that the vaccine protects the animals from a severe course of the disease. None of the monkeys got Covid 19 pneumonia. But in the nasopharynx the virus was able to multiply happily. So the animals were probably contagious anyway.

            " Instagram increases the pressure on TikTok: On Tuesday, the Facebook subsidiary announced that it would also test a new function called Reels for its more than 20 million users in Germany. Reels can be understood as Instagram's counterattack on TikTok, which has grown rapidly in popularity worldwide with its short video clips in recent months and years. Reels is not the first example of Facebook using up-and-coming competitors' ideas to make its own apps more attractive - something similar was observed when Snapchat's stories section became increasingly popular. \"Reels offers new opportunities to create and share short videos on Instagram,\" Instagram explains the new function. \"In a separate area in Explore, you can also discover, search for and interact with reels created by others on Instagram.\" It also says that the videos can be up to 15 seconds long and that the clips can be recorded and edited with audio, effects and new tools. Reels users can use their own audio recordings, but they can also make new videos of other users' recordings. All of this is very reminiscent of TikTok, which is particularly popular with young people. A sentence from the official press release on Reels also sounds as if the network was afraid that part of its target group would be missing TikTok-style videos on Instagram: \"With Reels we want to give everyone the opportunity to express themselves creatively and to be discovered\" Instagram writes, \"and look forward to giving a stage to a whole new generation of Instagram talent.\" Reels is a \"centerpiece for the future of entertainment on Instagram\". Instagram explains how to create and share a Reels video here. According to the description, the clips can be underlaid with your own and third-party sounds as well as with known songs that are part of the so-called Instagram music library. \"There are three ways to record reels,\" explains Instagram: \"As a series of clips (one by one), all at once, or you upload videos from your gallery.\" Reels videos are recorded and shared directly in the Instagram app. The service emphasizes that some of the 15-second videos will mark Instagram with the \"Featured\" note. These should be videos that curators, for example, classify as entertaining or culturally relevant. In addition to Germany, the Reels test is initially running in France and Brazil.\n",

According to their information, the companies concerned are the providers Tipico, Bwin and Bet3000, who are also known as organizers of sports betting and as partners and sponsors of the German Football League and major Bundesliga clubs. However, the ad is not directed against sports betting, but against the online casinos offered on the companies' websites, the legality of which is controversial. The three providers and other companies have licenses from abroad, for example Gibraltar or Malta, which, according to their legal opinion, also enable them to offer games of chance in Germany. However, the Federal Court of Justice (BGH) published a guiding principle decision of February 27, according to which online gambling is punishable without the approval of German authorities.

            " Until the outbreak of the corona pandemic, Economics Minister Peter Altmaier was considered a powerless appendix to the grand coalition. Hardly anyone took him seriously. His master plan, forcing German companies to become \"national economic champions\" if necessary with the help of the state, met with massive resistance. The pandemic has changed Altmaier's image. Suddenly it is seen as a ministerial steamroller that saves people and the economy from destruction with delicacies and tax billions. As of now, this has also been fairly successful. With his new coup, Altmaier exaggerates immeasurably. The federal government is investing 300 million euros in tax money in the Tübingen biotech company Curevac, which is working on a vaccine against Covid-19 (see also here). With a share of 23 percent, the Federal Republic of Germany becomes a shareholder in a company that plans to go public in the United States in the near future. In many ways, this is the wrong signal and does not solve any of the problems in the German biotech industry. Curevac does not need the federal government at all - neither to finance the expensive research on a vaccine nor as a shield against unwanted takeover by a foreign competitor, as Altmaier insinuated.

            " SPIEGEL: Mr. Schulze-Makuch, are there extraterrestrials, and if so, how many? There could be three dozen extraterrestrial civilizations in our home galaxy alone, the Milky Way, according to an article in the journal \"The Astrophysical Journal\". What is to be made of it? Dirk Schulze-Makuch, 56, professor of astrobiology at the TU Berlin, on extraterrestrial civilizations and the search for life on Mars, Jupiter or Saturn moons and distant planets Schulze-Makuch: Well, the authors assume that life pays off far distant planets go through very similar stages as life here. But the earth is not the measure of all things. We should free ourselves from this earth-centered idea. SPIEGEL: How would you look for life in space? Schulze-Makuch: Before we speculate about civilizations, we should rather look for unicellular organisms. I would see if I can find certain biosignals in the atmosphere of exoplanets, for example signs of oxygen that could come from microbes or plants that do photosynthesis. Or for references to methane, which may be produced by bacteria. SPIEGEL: Where would you look?

            " An apparently drunk adolescent barely escaped death on a railway line near the small town of Kirn in Rhineland-Palatinate. The youth had lay down on the track bed and was sleeping when a regional train passed over him. Around midnight, a railcar driver reported to the Deutsche Bahn control center that he had seen a person in the track bed. Train traffic at the point was then interrupted. When the emergency services arrived on site, they had to wake the intact 15-year-old. He said he didn't know where he was. He wanted to go home on foot and just want to rest a little, according to a police report in Kirn. The boy had been handed over to the father's care - \"after an insistent discussion and the clarification that today could also be seen as a second birthday,\" said the police.\n",

            " A New York police officer has been suspended from duty because of a prohibited stranglehold. Passers-by \"Stop choking him.\" Shortly after the incident in Queens on Sunday, the police released pictures of officers' body cameras. \"We take the matter very seriously,\" it says in the opening credits. \"We will keep the public informed.\" The pictures show how police officers talk to three men, a little later they fix 35-year-old African American Ricky B. on the floor. One of the officers presses the man's neck - apparently with a grip that the New York City Council banned after the death of African American George Floyd during a police operation in Minneapolis. A city council candidate released another video of the incident, which apparently one of the men was shooting. It can be seen that the officer Ricky B. apparently takes a stranglehold for about 10 seconds. Passerby \"He chokes. Let him go.\" Passerby \"He is free, he is free.\" Ricky B. was later taken to a police station and then to a hospital. According to media reports, he is said to be mentally ill. The operation against B. has a history: The New York cops had been called because a man would scream around. B. had then insulted the forces for minutes. Ricky B. \"What allegations? If you touch one of my boys, you're dead.\" Passerby \"Shut up.\" When he appeared to be reaching into a trash can and asked twice if the police were scared, they overwhelmed the man. The policeman who apparently used the stranglehold was suspended from duty without payment. The incident is being investigated.\n",

            " Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann will in future regularly explain to the Bundestag Finance Committee the monetary policy decisions of the European Central Bank (ECB). According to SPIEGEL information, the responsible leaders of the parliamentary groups have agreed on this. The so-called monetary dialogue is to take place once a quarter, the first meeting in the Berlin Reichstag is planned for the beginning of August at the latest. The decision is a consequence of the Federal Constitutional Court's ruling on the ECB's billion-dollar bond purchases in early May. The Karlsruhe judges complained that the ECB had not adequately justified the proportionality of the program. At the same time, they had asked the federal government and the Bundestag to provide more transparency on this issue. \"We want to meet this obligation,\" says CSU finance politician Hans Michelbach. In addition, the Bundesbank plans to send the ECB documents to the government in the coming week, which justify the bond purchases. The Bundestag could discuss this in its last week of session before the summer break. The constitutional judges had given the German state organs a three-month period to meet the requirements.

            " It is now known that climate change and higher average temperatures in Europe mean that snow borders are rising and glaciers are melting. The past decades of heat and warm winters have extremely shortened the snow season in low and high mountains. Climate researchers are now trying to quantify these changes. For the Alpine region, scientists have now measured for the first time how much glacial ice has disappeared between 2000 and 2014. The results of this inventory are dramatic: According to this, the glaciers of the Alps lost about a sixth (17 percent) of their ice volume in these 14 years alone - more than 22 cubic kilometers. The Swiss Alps are particularly affected, reports the research team from the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg in the journal \"Nature Communications\". In the study, the Erlangen geographers examined the entire Alps for the first time, instead of just individual glaciers or regions. To do this, they used data from radar satellites to create three-dimensional models of the earth's surface and combined them with optical satellite images. This enabled them to measure the area and height of the glaciers. \"The advantage is that you can see the glacier volume as a whole,\" says Christian Sommer from the Institute of Geography. Alpine glaciers: climate change at work The researchers found the greatest loss of ice in the Swiss Alps. \"These have the largest glacier areas and at the same time the highest melting rates,\" said Sommer. The surface of the Great Aletsch Glacier in the Swiss Valais, the largest glacier in the Alps, melted by more than five meters a year in the lower regions. \"In contrast, there does not seem to be any ice melting in the highest areas of the Central Alps,\" said Sommer. It is quite different in the outskirts, such as the Styrian Prealps: the researchers observed a decline in glaciers even in the higher altitudes. \"This suggests that the peripheral areas will be the first regions that will be ice-free in the future,\" says Sommer. The data also made it possible to look into the near future and to predict the development of the ice surfaces of a majority of the almost 4,000 alpine glaciers over the next few years. Predictions could also be made about the meltwater in the summer months, which is important for the water supply and energy generation in many countries. \"The melt has effects beyond the Alpine region because it affects the water balance of some large European river systems originating in the Alps,\" explains Sommer. Swiss researchers already ventured into the future last year. They predicted that the Alps could be completely ice-free by the end of the century. The research team also created a detailed forecast for all around 4,000 glaciers in the Alpine region. The result: by 2050, half of the glaciers in the Alps could have melted - regardless of whether it is still possible to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or not. Because the glacial melt only reacts very slowly to climate changes, the development in the coming decades will be unstoppable, according to the researchers in the study, which was published last September in the journal \"The Cryosphere\".\n",

            " This article will be updated continuously. Don't miss anything: Subscribe to our Coronavirus newsletter for the latest developments and key background information. 10:52 p.m .: According to the government, Italy will report an even higher budget deficit than previously assumed due to the corona crisis. A further increase is likely, said Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte. So far, a deficit of 10.4 percent has been assumed. However, the government is planning measures to prevent dismissals and wants to support badly hit areas such as the tourism industry, said Conte. He was also concerned that consumers would spend little money. Therefore, a reduction in VAT is being considered. There is no decision yet. 10:24 p.m .: The number of new infections in the USA in the corona crisis remains at the highest level for weeks. According to the CDC health authority, the number of people infected has recently climbed by 32,411 to just under 2.25 million. It had already reached around 32,000 on Saturday after having been significantly below this value since mid-May. At 560, however, the number of new deaths was again slightly lower than on the previous days. A total of 119,615 people in the United States have died as a result of an infection, according to official information. 9:22 p.m .: Thousands of spectators, hardly any distance, players celebrating in a club - Novak Djokovic's Adriatic tour seemed to take place in a world without corona virus. Now one participant was tested positive and the final was canceled. Read more here. 7:17 p.m .: France continues to loosen the restrictions imposed by the corona crisis on Monday. Campsites and cinemas can reopen under hygiene requirements. In addition, all stations of the Paris Metro should open again. Nationwide, most students are again required to attend. From Wednesday, tourists can also visit the Eiffel Tower again. Orly Paris Airport opens on Friday. For a week now, Germans and most other EU citizens have been able to enter France again without restrictions. President Emmanuel Macron had spoken of a \"first victory\" against the virus, the consequences of which have already killed more than 29,600 people in France. 7:07 p.m .: After the reproductive factor in Germany was already significantly above the critical mark at 1.79 on Saturday, it has now skyrocketed again. According to an estimate by the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), the value is now at 2.88. The increase is primarily due to locally limited outbreaks, including at a slaughterhouse near Gütersloh. The number of positive findings from Tönnies employees rose to 1,331 on Sunday. \"As the number of cases in Germany is low overall, these local outbreaks have a relatively strong impact on the value of the number of reproductions,\" said the RKI. \"Further developments will have to be observed over the next few days, particularly with regard to the question of whether there will be an increase in the number of cases outside the outbreaks described,\" said the RKI. The goal is a value of less than 1, because this reduces the number of infected people. This is also important in view of the question of whether loosening should be expanded or withdrawn. 5:32 pm: There have been riots in The Hague during protests against Corona measures. Mobile police commandos used water cannons and police horses to disperse the crowd. Several hundred demonstrators, including many hooligans, had deliberately sought to confront the police. \"This has nothing to do with a normal demonstration,\" said a police spokesman on the radio. Five people were arrested. According to the police, they had thrown stones. For security reasons, Mayor Johan Remkes initially prohibited the demonstration against Corona measures by the \"Virus Waanzin\" group. Nevertheless, a few hundred demonstrators had come to the main station and several hundred football fans, the police said. The mayor then allowed a brief rally. When the atmosphere became violent and especially hooligans wanted to move towards the city, the police intervened. A place near the main train station was cleared after several hundred demonstrators refused to leave it. Several people were arrested, the police said. A nearby shopping center had been closed as a precaution. 16:22: According to a survey, the corona crisis affects corporate research expenditure. 38 percent have reduced or even stopped their research and development activities, according to the survey by the Federal Association of German Industry (BDI) among 250 companies that was available to the \"Handelsblatt\". Before the crisis, only 13 percent said they wanted to cut their research spending compared to the previous year. In the crisis-ridden automotive industry, there are now even four fifths. \"This has dramatic consequences for the innovative strength and future viability of local companies,\" warned the member of the BDI general management, Iris Plöger. At the same time, the goal of the grand coalition is at risk of increasing overall economic spending on research and development (R&D) from 3.1 to 3.5 percent of gross domestic product by 2025. The BDI therefore calls for extra support for innovative companies. 3:46 pm: After the corona outbreak in the meat factory in Tönnies, NRW Minister of Health Karl-Josef Laumann (CDU) has threatened an even sharper policy stance against the meat industry. With the meat industry \"there can be no voluntary agreements, only clear legal requirements, no matter who the owner is,\" said Laumann after crisis talks in the Gütersloh district concerned. Laumann called for more transparency in the company, especially with regard to reporting requirements and working time recording. Tönnies has refused to introduce digital time recording until the end, the minister criticized. At the end of May, there were no complaints in an OSH report. At the same time, however, Laumann expressed distrust in the results. \"It takes time until he gets to where the music is playing,\" he said of the health and safety issues involved in controlling the slaughterhouses. The authorities had to go through a number of locks before the tests, until they were on site. 3:29 p.m .: Eight police officers were injured in riots at a quarantined residential complex in Göttingen. The task force was thrown at with bottles, stones, metal bars, household items and pyrotechnics, said the head of operations. Previously, around 80 to 100 residents had gathered around the barrier of the building complex on Saturday afternoon. With \"massive use of pepper spray\" the officials would have prevented the barrier from being broken. Now, among other things, are being investigated for dangerous bodily harm. After an hour, the situation calmed down, it said. The around 700 residents of the residential complex were placed in quarantine on Thursday. According to the city, some families of six live in precarious conditions in the apartments, which are only 19 to 37 square meters in size. According to initial test results, around 17 percent of those living there are infected with the novel corona virus, according to authorities. 3:07 p.m .: World Athletics Association World Athletics supports 193 athletes worldwide with a one-time payment of $ 3,000 each from its Corona Aid Fund set up at the end of April. The association announced on Sunday. A group of experts chaired by World Athletics President Sebastian Coe (Great Britain) had decided on the applications for support. Among other things, in addition to the need, it was a prerequisite that no athlete had violated anti-doping guidelines in his career. The money should be transferred at the end of the week. 2:40 p.m .: The number of corona infected people in the Tönnies meat factory in Rheda-Wiedenbrück rose to 1331. This was announced by the district of Gütersloh. The series tests on the company's premises were completed on Saturday, it said. A total of 6139 tests were carried out, 5899 results were already available. The virus could not be detected in 4568 employees. \"The tests showed that the number of positive results outside the decomposition is significantly lower than in this part of the company,\" it said. 21 Covid-19 patients are currently being treated in hospital in the four hospitals in the district. Six of these are in the intensive care unit, two of whom require ventilation. According to the district, five of the six are Tönnies employees.

            " 2:33 p.m .: The Swiss Corona app SwissCovid app for mobile phones will be available from June 25th. It can be downloaded from the Apple Store and the Google Play Store, it said on Sunday on the website of the Federal Office of Public Health (BAG). It is intended to supplement the manual tracing of contacts if someone has been infected with the corona virus. That helps stop transmission chains. Use is voluntary and free of charge. However, the more people install and use the app, the more effectively it helps to contain the new corona virus. Anja Karliczek 2:22 p.m .: Federal Education Minister Anja Karliczek still does not believe that a full return to normal school operations after the summer vacation is certain. \"The virus is not gone, and we have to reckon with the fact that schools have to be closed if someone gets infected there,\" said the CDU politician of the \"Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung\". How fragile the situation is can be seen in North Rhine-Westphalia. \"We must continue to act with caution.\" In the meantime, the federal states are striving to return to normal operations after the summer vacation. \"I very much hope that the infection will allow this development,\" said Karliczek. However, the past few weeks have shown how important regular and personal contact between students and teachers is. Homeschooling has \"very clear limits\". \"That's why face-to-face teaching naturally keeps its meaning. Without ifs and buts. But school and lessons are becoming more digital overall.\" 2:04 pm: According to Pope Francis, the significant decrease in pollution during the global corona closures should lead to greater environmental awareness. \"The cordon has reduced pollution and once again demonstrated the beauty of so many places free from traffic and noise,\" said the Pope at St. Peter's Square in Rome. \"Now that the activities have resumed, we should all take more responsibility for taking care of our common home.\" Due to curfews and factory closures, air and water pollution had declined sharply in many places. In Venice, for example, the water was so clean due to the reduced boat traffic that fish could be seen in the canals for the first time in many years. 2:03 p.m .: The district of Gütersloh has information that employees had left the Rheda-Wiedenbrück site for all Tönnies employees before the quarantine was imposed. \"We have noticed increased mobility,\" said a district spokeswoman. That was brought to the circle of citizens. \"At the time, we had no way of preventing this.\" The district had ordered the quarantine on Friday. It also applies to all employees' household members. According to the company, around 6,500 people work at the Rheda-Wiedenbrück site, Germany's largest slaughterhouse. According to a spokesman, around half of all employees in the entire Tönnies group of companies work for Tönnies via subcontractors. In total, people from 87 nations work for tonnies. By far the largest groups come from Romania and Poland. Around a third of employees with foreign nationality live with their families in Germany. According to the district spokeswoman, the head of the crisis team, Thomas Kuhlbusch, has already contacted the embassies of the countries of origin in connection with the departures. 1:00 p.m .: China suspends imports of poultry from the listed US meat processor Tyson after a corona attack in a company. The customs authorities announced this on their website. According to the information, a slaughterhouse in Springdale in the US state of Arizona is affected, where there has been an accumulation of corona cases among employees. Tyson didn't want to speak at first. China has tightened controls on imported food after there have been numerous new coronavirus infections in Beijing's largest food market. For example, meat, seafood and fresh products are tested for the corona virus in the capital. The People's Republic had recently stopped importing pork products from the German Tönnies group. After the outbreak of the corona virus in a slaughterhouse in the Gütersloh district, the number of infected employees had risen to more than a thousand. The corona virus had already broken out several times in slaughterhouses. This has triggered a debate about problematic working and accommodation conditions in the meat industry and the widespread work contracts there. 11:24: The North Rhine-Westphalian State Cabinet deals in a special session with the Corona outbreak at Tönnies. The state government wants to reassess the situation, Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) announced on Friday. He had expressly not ruled out a regional lockdown. The series tests of a total of 6500 employees on the premises of the Tönnies company in Rheda-Wiedenbrück will continue on Sunday. Around 5800 samples had been taken by midday on Saturday. 3127 findings were available: Corona virus was detected in 1029 employees, in 2098 the result was negative. 65 Bundeswehr soldiers help with the sampling.

According to the Robert Koch Institute, the application had been downloaded around 10.6 million times by Saturday afternoon. Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn (CDU) described the number in the \"Bild am Sonntag\" as a \"strong signal of unity\". We can be proud of more than ten million downloads. The app was thus downloaded more often \"than the corona apps of all other EU countries combined,\" said Spahn. 10:53 am: Given a significant increase in new infections, Israel's Ministry of Health has instructed the country's hospitals to reopen their corona departments. A spokesman for the ministry confirmed that a corresponding letter had been sent to the clinics. Israel's Corona Cabinet planned to meet in the afternoon for an emergency meeting to discuss possible steps to contain the pandemic. There has also been an increase in new infections in the Palestinian Territories in recent days. A report released by the Israeli Army Secret Service on Saturday warned urgently of a second wave of corona. Without rapid containment measures, the country would have to expect the number of new infections to rise to more than a thousand a day within a month. Then hundreds of dead are to be feared. 10:29 a.m .: According to the government's official assessment, there is no end in sight to the corona crisis by 2022. Health minister Saeid Namaki said the expectation that we would have to live with Corona for another two years, according to a report by the Isna news agency. The virus has different dimensions, is therefore very complicated and quasi like an animal \"that can both bite and kick\". After a temporary drop in infections in May, Iran eased protective measures. Work is allowed again in almost all industries. Fewer and fewer people take hygiene regulations seriously. According to experts, the result is a further increase in the number of cases. It has been proven that more than 200,000 Iranians have been infected since the end of February. More than 9500 have died from or with the virus. 10.11 a.m .: The authoritarian-ruled Caucasus Republic of Azerbaijan has imposed two-week curfews due to rising corona infections in several regions. This was announced by the Ministry of Health. The capital Baku is also affected. You can only leave the apartment with permission, which is sent by SMS. Shopping centers, hairdressing salons, restaurants and museums are no longer allowed to open. Quarantine measures to date regarding the epidemic have been extended until August 1, the government said. This also applies to entering and leaving the country on the Caspian Sea. According to official information, there are more than 12,200 corona cases in the former Soviet Republic. 150 people died. Azerbaijan borders Iran, which is also badly affected by the pandemic. The Blue Mosque and Hagia Sofia in Istanbul are popular with visitors to Turkey at 8.34 a.m .: The Turkish Community in Germany (TGD) is dissatisfied with the Federal Government's continuing travel warning for Turkey. \"Millions of Turkish citizens would like to visit their relatives in Turkey in the summer, but the uncertainty is great - we are receiving more and more inquiries and calls,\" said TGD chairman Gökay Sofuoglu to the newspapers of the editorial network Germany. In particular, the quarantine regulations responsible for the federal states unsettled many people. \"The Turkish government has given an undertaking to test vacationers for the corona virus before departure and not to let them leave the country in the event of a positive test,\" said Sofoglu. \"The federal government has to say quickly whether the Turkish health certificates are accepted nationwide or not.\" The 14-day quarantine obligations for returnees from Turkey that currently apply in many places made it difficult for many German Turks, but also for other holidaymakers, to stay in Turkey, said Sofoglu. \"After returning from vacation, people have to go back to work. Removing the quarantine requirement for healthy returnees would make life easier for many.\" 8.13 a.m .: The North Rhine-Westphalian Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) wants to advise the responsible crisis team after the severe corona outbreak at the meat company Tönnies. He arrived in Gütersloh in the morning with his health minister Karl-Josef Laumann (CDU). The politicians want to talk to members of the crisis team first, then a special meeting of the state cabinet via video conference is planned, as a spokeswoman for the state chancellery said. In the afternoon, Laschet and Laumann want to speak to the press. Laschet had not ruled out a region lockdown a few days ago. The district administrator of the district of Gütersloh, Sven-Georg Adenauer (CDU), wants to prevent this. The number of corona infections at the meat company Tönnies in Rheda-Wiedenbrück in the Gütersloh district had risen to more than a thousand by yesterday afternoon. Out of 3,127 findings, 1,029 were positive, District Administrator Adenauer said at a press conference. The head of the meat company, Clemens Tönnies, apologized for the events. 5.20 a.m .: The local authorities reported 687 corona infections to the Robert Koch Institute within one day. Since the beginning of the corona crisis, 189,822 people in Germany have been shown to have contracted Sars-CoV-2, the RKI reported. So far, according to the RKI, 8882 have been shown to have been infected with the virus, reducing the number of reported deaths by one within 24 hours. According to RKI estimates, 174,900 people survived the infection. The RKI estimates that the number of reproductions, or R-value for short, as of June 20, 00:00, was 1.79 (previous day: 1.06). This means that an infected person infects more than one other person on average. The R value shows the infection process approximately one and a half weeks beforehand. 5:00 a.m .: The left in the Bundestag calls for tougher conditions for companies applying for state aid due to the corona pandemic. At the moment, such groups could also receive loans from the KfW state development bank that would have paid dividends during the crisis, complained the financial politician Fabio De Masi. According to the Ministry of Finance, it is crucial that this does not happen after the loan application. In special cases, KfW can also request distributions that were made before that. \"The rules for state aid are too soft,\" said De Masi of the German press agency. \"The federal government must announce that it will no longer grant state aid after the dividend has been distributed,\" he said. Even companies that apply for short-time work benefits would have to forego dividends because short-time work is also a form of state aid. De Masi also called for stricter measures to shift profits to tax havens and better control over commitments to waive manager bonuses. 4.38 a.m .: After the new outbreak of coronavirus in Beijing, the number of infected people has increased further. According to the state health commission, 22 further infections were detected in the capital. A total of 26 newly infected people were reported nationwide. In response to the new outbreak that started at the city's Xinfadi wholesale market last week, the authorities announced the second highest security level on Tuesday, partially sealing off Beijing. Flights from and to the capital have been drastically reduced. Bus traffic to other provinces has also ceased. People should no longer leave the city. If travel is necessary, a negative corona test must be available. 3.34 a.m .: Bundesliga soccer team Union Berlin has accepted the fines for violations of the corona regulations by the German soccer league. \"The total is in the five-figure range if you add everything up,\" said managing director Oliver Ruhnert at the ZDF sports studio. Union professionals Christopher Trimmel (33) and Sheraldo Becker (25) and the club itself were fined on Friday. The two players \"had obviously violated general hygiene and infection protection standards after the Bundesliga game against SC Paderborn 07\" and in particular the DFL concept, the umbrella organization had announced. This can be seen on video recordings, among other things in social networks. The pictures are falsified because the team did not celebrate with the fans, said the 47-year-old Ruhnert. Trimmel had been out a little early, the security staff hadn't been there yet, and the player had then \"landed in the fans. In short, you have to say, really only briefly, and then went back. But you have to say it was a mistake, \"said Ruhnert. Unfortunately, Becker then got out of his car after he got no further and had a short photo taken. \"Everything is humanly understandable, but not right in these times,\" said the managing director of Union. Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro initially describes the corona virus as \"light flu\" 2:04 am: The number of corona deaths in Brazil has risen to almost 50,000. So far, 49,976 patients have died in connection with the lung disease Covid-19, said the Brazilian Ministry of Health. That was 1022 more than the day before. Over a million people have been shown to be infected with the novel corona virus. According to experts, the actual number is likely to be much higher, since Brazil tests relatively little. The largest country in Latin America is second only to the United States in terms of both infections and deaths. Right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro initially called the coronavirus \"light flu\" and still fights against exit restrictions. The head of state fears the economic damage of a lockdown. A number of states and cities have taken protective measures on their own, but restrictions are already being relaxed in many places. 1.33 a.m .: Spain has reopened its borders to European travelers after more than three months. During the night of Sunday, the country lifted the state of emergency imposed on March 14 due to the corona crisis and reopened its land border with France and its ports and airports for people from the European Union. The border with Portugal will remain closed until July 1st. People from the EU and Schengen countries no longer have to go into a two-week quarantine when entering the country. Around 600 officials from the Ministry of Health will measure the temperature at airports for travelers arriving from abroad. The Spaniards are also allowed to travel in their own country again. 1:00 am: Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann sees the German economy on the right track in the corona crisis. \"In the past few months we have experienced the sharpest economic downturn in the history of the Federal Republic,\" said Weidmann of the \"Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung\". \"The good news is: the low point should be behind us now and things are looking up again.\" Weidmann said that the significant slump in the German economy was only followed by a \"comparatively gradual recovery\". The Bundesbank President emphasized that in the event of a bankruptcy wave in autumn, the state had enough scope to support the economy again. \"Politicians reacted quickly and courageously in a difficult environment to protect companies and employees. That was correct.\" Politicians should not get used to the high level of debt. 00:44: The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to relax the distance rules, according to a report by the \"Daily Telegraph\". On Tuesday, he would announce that from July 4, offices, schools and pubs would only have to be kept at least one meter away if additional protective measures were used, such as wearing a nose and throat protector. A distance of two meters is currently prescribed in England. 13.\n",

            " The lion cubs at Leipzig Zoo are no longer nameless: the three siblings were named Mateo, Hanna and Elsa, the zoo announced. 13,000 people took part in a vote that decided what the big cats should be called. You could choose from a total of 8000 suggestions. Mateo means \"heavenly gift\" and is of Hebrew origin, Hanna was named after a seriously ill child and Elsa bears the name of a lioness from the film classic \"Free born - Queen of the wild\". At the end of December 2019, the lion mother Kigali gave birth to quintuplets. However, after a routine vaccination, the lioness had attacked her offspring and fatally injured two young animals. The lioness had already killed and eaten her first litter in August. The phenomenon that parent animals eat the offspring is also called Kronism. Such behavior occurs in nature, for example when young animals are weakened or sick. The surviving young animals of the December litter have been growing up with their father since the new incident. The three little ones are exploring the Makasi Simba lion savannah with increasing confidence, as the zoo announced. Because of the regulations for protection against the corona virus, the baptism had to take place without visitors. It was broadcast via live stream.\n",

            " The Schwarz Group (parent company of Lidl and Kaufland) takes over the online marketplace real.de. The platform is to be continued under the name of Kaufland and complement the previously largely stationary range of Kaufland, as the group announced. No information was given on the purchase price. The company, which operates more than 12,000 branches worldwide with Lidl and Kaufland and has sales of more than 100 billion euros, has had little presence in e-commerce to date. Online food retailing has experienced a boom in the corona crisis. The group now apparently wants to close its gap: \"Real.de is an essential component of our future offering. The combination of brick-and-mortar business and online trading will open up additional opportunities for us,\" said Rolf Schumann, Chief Digital Officer of the Schwarz Group. Real.de had grown strongly recently. The announced sale of real.de is also the next step in the smashing of the hypermarket chain Real. In the spring, the real parent company Metro announced the sale of the subsidiary, including the digital business, to the Russian financial investor SCP. This transaction is expected to close this Thursday. After the takeover, SCP wants to sell the troubled department store chain quickly, piece by piece. The financial investor had already announced at the end of March that 141 of the more than 270 real stores were to be sold to Kaufland and Edeka. Now the digital business should also go to Kaufland. The financial investor described the sale as \"another important step\" in the implementation of his plans. The transfer from real.de to the Schwarz Group is still subject to the completion of the acquisition of Real by SCP, which is scheduled for June 25, and the approval of the takeover under antitrust law.\n",

            " After more than 1000 employees tested positive for the corona virus in the Tönnies meat factory, the city of Verl in the district of Gütersloh took consequences: In the district of Sürenheide, several apartment buildings that house the company's contract workers were placed in quarantine. As the city announced, the entire area was cordoned off in the afternoon. Almost 670 people live in the houses on three streets. Quarantine also affects those who are not Tönnies employees. \"We are aware that with the general quarantine we intervene deeply in the lives of the people living there, even if they work somewhere else and have no points of contact with the company Tönnies other than the neighborhood,\" said Mayor Michael Esken. \"But we must do everything we can to reduce the spread of the virus as much as possible. Strict quarantine compliance is essential,\" he said. According to the Bielefeld police, the area was initially cordoned off by emergency services. At the same time, city employees had started to erect fences. According to the city, 78 residents tested positive for the corona virus on Zollhausweg alone, one of the three streets. On Sunday, the district health office wants to take a throat swab from all residents in the zone who have not yet been tested. The German Red Cross provides packed lunches and drinks for the first two days. \"For families with small children, if necessary, hygiene articles such as diapers are provided,\" it said. For the remaining days, a supply center with food and hygiene articles for daily needs within the quarantine area will be set up. The Red Cross said that catering would also be provided for the Tönnies employees: \"It is the job of the Tönnies company, which has also agreed to do so, but if it does not go smoothly, we can step in.\" Other accommodations of Tönnies employees in the city area are also to be checked at irregular intervals in order to check compliance with the quarantine regulations. In the event of violations, a standby service can promptly issue regulatory notices.\n",

            " Today a small tour of important breaking news of the week in the field of criminal law. The breaking news, called \"Breaking News\" by the transatlantic allies of the Wiesbaden retail trade and the southern Palatinate artisanship, is the royal jelly of news. Because it is so beautiful, the running lines with the urgent messages are now displayed as a fixed design part in the program to be broken. This raises the question of whether there is any kind of concentration in the audience that can be broken by news. And the question of how to conceptually master the cascade of urgent breaks, which inevitably arises when the exception becomes the rule: What type of news do breaking news break? We make it easy for ourselves today and claim that everything is equally important. So somehow totally. Torgelow is not in the Uckermark. But just off the mark. I know that, as I have to admit, not from home economics classes, but from a search engine. Philipp Amthor is also not the chancellor's foster son, and certainly not Mr Maassen's nephew, who looks at us from photos that also show the hopefully completed Torgelow star. Such a coincidence happens, and after all, no one has ever taken a secret snapshot of Mr. Amthor in Times Square as it once happened to the wife of Baroness von and zu Guttenberg, who, together with Dorothea von Eberhardt, Marina von Acht, Donata von Hardenberg , Alice von Seldeneck and Julia von Weiler fights for children's innocence worldwide. Born in 1953, is a legal scientist and was chairman of the 2nd criminal senate of the Federal Court of Justice. He is the author of an annually revised standard short commentary on the Criminal Code and numerous other specialist books. Now Mr. Amthor, who is 27 years old and, as you hear, would like to become Prime Minister soon, has a problem with a good friend, the world economist Friedrich M. from Brilon in Hochsauerland, who said about well-informed circles about Amthor: \"I hope that he can clarify the matter and continue his political work afterwards.\" With such solidarity addresses, the party to which the two smarties belong belongs to the extent that the oven is off. But in view of the deafening Sauerland silence \"in these times\" since March, it is not currently known whether there is still a fire in Brilon that could break the Amthorian embers. So much in the Schadenfreude and Moral Butter Cream department. As you read, three-quarters of Germany is outraged again and demands that Amthor \"resign\" from all offices that he does not yet have because of the stock options that he no longer has but received from friends that he never had. And of course because of all the expensive champagne with the billionaires of tomorrow, the rulers of yesterday and the barons of Dingsda. What a decent German consumer, taxpayer, voter and patient would never drink, and certainly would never be invited to, and certainly not told his boss that he knew a highly recommended supplier, and at the same time forgot to mention that it was was his brother-in-law's nephew. As you can hear, a public prosecutor's office is said to have already started to carry out a \"pre-investigation\" which, according to the law, should not exist at all or only for a logical second of paragraph 152 (2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. With future prime ministers of all ages, it can sometimes take a little longer to carefully determine whether there is any indication of anything. In the present case, one has to look at paragraph 108e of the Criminal Code (\"Criminal Code\"), \"bribery of officials\", a crime that is so terrible that it will probably never happen because of the high threat of punishment: minimum sentence five daily rates of one euro (paragraph 40 paragraph 1 and 2) or a month (paragraph 38 paragraph 2). The regulation was so thoroughly renovated a few years ago after decades of trying that it will remain so in the future if the mandate holder is not really stupid. And even if Friedrich M. thinks that Amthor has \"screwed up\", his intelligence and tendency to be important seem to be within the range of what can be expected on average. Speaking of terrible crime: \"A less serious abuse,\" said Federal Minister of Justice and Consumer Protection in the German Bundestag on June 18, 2020, \"will no longer exist.\" This is a cryptic sentence that aggregates what is possible in terms of content, language, logic and morality in such a small space. But the sentence also has an advantage: it hardly understands it from those to whom it is addressed. The Minister of Justice knows that; that's why she says yes. There are three criminal offenses in Germany's criminal law world where there is no less serious case: murder (paragraph 211 of the Criminal Code), genocide in cases under paragraph 6 (1) number 1 of the International Criminal Code (VStGB) and crimes against humanity in cases under paragraph 7 Paragraph 1 number 1 VStGB. In these three cases, an \"absolute\" punishment is threatened: life imprisonment. It is called \"Absolute\" because it cannot be determined from a \"punitive framework\", but is limited by the life of the convict. Of course, this does not mean that there is no murder that no one finds \"less difficult\". Would you like a sample? Case one: A kidnaps a five-year-old child and kills it for sexual motivation. Case Two: The child's father, B, shoots murderer A from behind in the hallway of the court. Questions: Do you think that both cases are morally exactly the same? Do you think one case is \"harder\" and one is \"less difficult\"? If you had a sentence of 10 to 30 years, which penalties did you consider appropriate in the two cases? The example shows that there are at least two levels of \"less difficult\": a legal and a moral level. In the penal code, of course, the word dominates, i.e. the systematic meaning that is expressed in the wording. However, this is, of course, an assessment that must \"fill in\", \"apply\" the words of the law with meaning. That is no different in criminal law than it is in life: \"Heavy duty crane\" is not the name of a machine because it can only lift particularly light loads, and not because it is difficult to operate. So you have to think about what \"less difficult\" is supposed to mean. The wording has no meaning in itself, but only gains it in relation to something, and in two ways: First, \"heavy\" is a property in a unit of measure: perhaps kilograms, or \"guilt\". Second, \"less difficult\" is a quantitative description that relates to an unknown quantity of that unit of measure. We talk in criminal law when we talk about less serious \"cases\", less less guilt. Guilt, if we refrain from \"original sin\", not as an abstract characteristic of a person, but in relation to certain actions: You cannot compare the guilt of a killing with the guilt of a fraud as an abstract quantity, but only as a guilty guilt and fraud guilt . So the law speaks of cases of realizing a certain fact: less serious case of killing, less serious case of fraud and so on. What is \"less difficult\" can therefore not be deduced from an abstract category \"weight\" or \"guilt\", but from the respective facts. Case law already found a formula for the determination many decades ago: \"Cases are less serious which, after an overall assessment of all relevant circumstances, the consequences of the crime and the person of the perpetrator deviate so far from the average number of cases that the imposition of the sentence would be inappropriate. \" You have to read this definition carefully and carefully and try to imagine what is meant. The robbery is punished with imprisonment from one to 15 years (paragraph 249 paragraph 1 StGB), the \"less serious case of theft\" with six months to five years (paragraph 249 paragraph 2). As a result, there is a sliding scale of \"severity\" for \"normal\" robbery (taking away a moveable foreign item by force or threatening to use it), which must be classified in the penalty range from 1 to 15. Below these normal cases, there are still \"less severe\" cases. They are designed in such a way that a sentence of up to five years can be imposed for a less serious case of robbery, ie four years more (!) Than for the most easily conceivable \"normal\" robbery (lower limit one year). That sounds complicated and theoretically it is. In practice it is usually easier and works according to the principle: I don't know exactly what it is, but when I see it, I recognize it. If a person threatens to take a purse from a passerby under severe violence, it is probably a \"normal\" robbery. If a drunk homeless man gives a booze a push and takes half a bottle of beer away from him, it is probably a \"less difficult case\". Transferred to sexual abuse: If a 50-year-old kidnapped vaginally on a 6-year-old child, it is most likely a \"serious case\". If an 18-year-old touches his 13-year-old girlfriend (!) Briefly (!) With his finger (!) Between the labia, there is probably a \"less difficult case\". After these tips back to the Federal Minister of Justice: Until the beginning of the two-thousand years, paragraph 176 of the Criminal Code had threatened sexual abuse of children for decades; in paragraph 2 there was a lower sentence for \"less serious cases\". Everyone knew what it meant - see above. Then \"victim protectors\" came up with the strange idea that it was \"unreasonable for victims (!) That their case be classified by the court as less difficult\". That was a rarely stupid argument because it was not about being \"irrelevant\", but a comparison with very severe and average cases. And in the rule of law the judge is entitled, not the victim. However, the legislature dutifully deleted the \"less serious case\" in paragraph 176. At the same time, paragraph 176a introduced a \"particularly serious case\", for example for cases of \"penetration into the body\" (wherever and with whatever). In this regulation, a \"less serious case\" was now introduced: it was apparently not \"unreasonable\" to hear the victims. So there is the \"less difficult case of the particularly difficult case\"! Anyone who thinks this is nonsense is not wrong. Now, because a few particularly serious cases of abuse have been uncovered, the sentence for less serious cases should be abolished. And the sentence for \"normal cases\" should always be at least one year; from a legal point of view, this turns the act from \"crime\" to \"crime\". For the serious cases that are the subject of the reporting, this does not matter in the least. At the lower end of trivial acts - there are! - cut off all possibilities of a comparatively mild criminal law application. I don't understand why a previously inconspicuous young person, who for the first time and sexually touches a 13-year-old child with his consent and without any identifiable harmful consequences over his clothing, must be imprisoned with at least one year imprisonment, even if so many Call executioner after decades of harsh punishment. The counter arguments that terrible deeds and serious consequences are possible go nowhere, because the assumption of a \"less serious case\" is out of the question for such deeds. So the whole thing is once again a linguistic feat with far-reaching consequences and high concealment potential: the poorly understood mass of the outraged is somehow served with symbols; nothing comes out for the potential and actual victims. The plan seems particularly misguided to make the possession (!) Of child pornography and data on \"crime\" with a minimum penalty of one year. This has what it takes to catch up with the facts in authoritarian dictatorships: The lonely looking at a forbidden writing or drawing without any intention of dissemination is threatened with long-term criminal penalties. Just in passing: the spreading and having of the construction plans for atomic bombs is unpunished. On June 18, the Berlin \"Raser\" judgment was partially overturned for the second time by the 4th BGH criminal division, to the extent that it concerned the accused, whose vehicle did not ram the killed driver. On the basis of the Senate press release, it is difficult to judge how convincing the reasoning is: the assessment of evidence should be erroneous because the defendant was not found to be free of errors that the joint crime plan (to run a race and put third parties at risk) ) \"implicitly expanded\" to the conditionally intentional killing. Oh well. You really can't get rid of the impression that the requirements for the intent are somewhat dependent on the coincidence which of the two drivers ends up colliding with a third party. It will have to be seen what is detailed in the reasons for the BGH decision. In any case, it is important to note that the Senate adheres to the conventional idea of ​​\"conditional intent\" as knowledge of the possibility of success and cheap acceptance (cognitive and voluntary element) and demands separate, concrete statements of both. This is to be welcomed insofar as the tendencies of an extreme softening of the concept of intent towards gross negligence have not become established in dogmatics. Apart from the (outrageous) individual case, this can only be found well. The BGH will tell us why the \"racers\" who drive through the inner-city thirties at 70, know the extreme danger for children playing, but stupid or overconfident hope that nothing will happen, not everyone is punishable for attempted murder explain in his judgment. And finally, a look behind the prison walls into the fascinating world of serial killers: \"Murderer solves mathematical problem\", headlined the \"Süddeutsche Zeitung\" (\"SZ\") on June 16. The story goes like this: Murderer X, initially as stupid as bread, begins in (of course: American) prison with algebra, then he discovers higher mathematics. He is allowed to read specialist books on the condition \"that he agrees to teach other prisoners\" (whoever believes it is his own fault). He is getting smarter and eventually finds evidence of a math problem. In a (as I determined: largely unknown) journal he publishes this together with a university lecturer who supports him. Killer can do math! Who would have thought that? The murderer also achieved remarkable things as a teacher: The \"SZ\" reported that one of his 14 students could now recite the first 461 digits of the number Pi. Brilliant! You can see what a really long punishment can be good for. At this point I have to mention that the publication took place three years ago. So a breaking news of the third kind. But a hope for everyone who can no longer commit less serious cases.\n",

            " Central banks and supervisors worldwide want to give greater weight to climate change and the associated economic and financial risks. The Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), a global network of 66 central banks and regulators, published new recommendations on Wednesday on how to take such factors more into account in risk management in the financial sector. \"We have to understand and communicate the effects of climate change and the countermeasures taken even better. We can only do this if we make climate models an integral component of our analyzes and forecasting methods,\" said Bundesbank board member Sabine Mauderer in a guest contribution for the \"Börsen-Zeitung\" . The NGFS scenarios show how climate change can affect important economic variables - including those that are relevant to monetary policy. For example, extreme weather conditions and a rise in temperature could disrupt supply chains in the short term or even permanently. As a result, prices would fluctuate more, and central banks would have to correct short-term inflation expectations more frequently. This is not without problems, because the inflation rate is a key parameter for monetary policy. \"Of course, climate models are technically demanding and complex. That is why central banks and supervisory authorities will have to explain their financial and economic analyzes for households, governments and the financial sector even more actively in the future,\" wrote Bundesbank board member Mauderer in the article written together with Sarah Breeden from the Bank of England in the \"Börsen-Zeitung\": \"The more we know what is at stake, the clearer it is now time to act.\"\n",

            " At its meeting in Erfurt, the Interior Ministers' Conference (IMK) agreed on the demand that serious sexual abuse of children should in future be classified as homicide with regard to the seriousness of the crime. This emerges from a proposal for a resolution that was launched after the interior ministers' agreement talks and which is available to SPIEGEL. The push goes back to North Rhine-Westphalia's Interior Minister Herbert Reul (CDU). According to the IMK, the paper states that acts such as serious sexual abuse of children and sexual abuse of children with fatal consequences are based on \"a high level of criminal energy and an anti-child and inhuman attitude\". This is \"comparable in terms of wrongdoing to a homicide within the meaning of Section 212 of the Criminal Code\". Paragraph 212 deals with the homicide crime. In this context, the interior ministers are calling for \"an adjustment of the criminal procedural regulations\". Serious sexual abuse of children and abuse of children with fatal consequences should \"be included in the Code of Criminal Procedure as an absolute reason for detention\", the proposed resolution says. This meant that in future the seriousness of the crime alone would justify the suspect's pre-trial detention. According to the IMK, investigative authorities should also be able to gain further access to telecommunications content in child abuse proceedings. The abuse case in Münster, in which there are now 18 suspects, has recently sparked a debate over tightening the sentences. Federal Justice Minister Christine Lambrecht (SPD) had turned around after criticism and wants to get tougher punishments on the way. The interior ministers of the federal states have long been demanding that the possession and distribution of child pornography should always be classified as a crime and not just as a crime. There should be a minimum prison sentence of one year. \"We need a clear signal,\" said Reul SPIEGEL, \"such crimes destroy lives.\" The IMK paper states: \"The Interior Ministers' Conference reaffirms its view that combating child abuse / child pornography is one of the most important socio-political tasks of our time.\"\n",

            " In the scandal surrounding the alleged illegal resale of seized bicycles to the Saxon police, the interior minister of the state, Roland Wöller (CDU), rejected allegations that he had informed the public too late and insufficiently. According to local media reports, he said at a press conference that he could not provide information on the ongoing investigation, that it was up to the public prosecutor. State Police President Horst Kretzschmar did not comment on the ongoing investigations on details in the so-called bicycle gate. In order not to disturb them, the public was not informed, he said according to the newspaper \"Dresdner Latest News\" (DNN). For example, it is still open since when the business with the confiscated bikes has been running. The General Prosecutor's Office in Dresden, where the proceedings are now ongoing, does not comment on this either. The scandal surrounding the allegedly illegal resale of seized bicycles was made known by a report by the \"Dresdener Morgenpost\". The prosecutor's office is investigating numerous police officers. The newspaper had initially reported that a 43-year-old policewoman had sold over a thousand seized bicycles cheaply through an intermediary association within four years. Instead of a non-profit organization, they are said to have ended up with police officers and their families. \"The group of perpetrators is so extensive, however, that it has not yet been identified to this day,\" quotes the \"Sächsische Zeitung\" CDU politician Wöller. \"This is a clear indication of the serious events in the Leipzig police department,\" he said. He hoped that all those responsible would be quickly identified and punished for their actions. Leipzig police chief Torsten Schultze admitted, according to the DNN, to be \"deeply disappointed\" about the events in his office. The loss of trust in the police is enormous.\n",

            " Shortly before the Lufthansa shareholders' decision to enter the state, Federal Minister of Finance Olaf Scholz (SPD) and Federal Minister of Economics Peter Altmaier (CDU) again campaigned for the federal government's offer. \"There is a good offer on the table and Lufthansa shareholders should accept it,\" said Scholz. The federal government is offering support to Lufthansa and its more than one hundred thousand employees \"in an unprecedented emergency\", the aid package is also \"the legitimate interests of taxpayers.\" The EU Commission had previously approved the rescue package. However, the release of the recapitalization aid in the amount of six billion euros is subject to the condition that the largest German airline complies with obligations to avoid distortions of competition. These include the fact that Lufthansa has to surrender take-off and landing rights at the main locations in Frankfurt am Main and Munich. This should enable the competition to build a base with up to four aircraft at the locations. Altmaier welcomed the decision of the EU Commission. \"This clears the way for the support package,\" he said. It is \"right and important\" to help the company that has been hard hit by the consequences of the corona pandemic: \"It is about hundreds of thousands of jobs and it is about Germany's position on the world markets.\" Chairman of the supervisory board, Karl-Ludwig Kley, also campaigned for the state rescue package. Without support, Lufthansa could face bankruptcy in the coming days, said Kley at the virtual general meeting. \"We have no more money.\" He asked the shareholders for approval so that Lufthansa could continue their previous successes. The rescue plan for Lufthansa stipulates that the state should join the stricken airline. Specifically, the State Economic Stabilization Fund (WSF) is to subscribe to shares in the course of a capital increase in order to build up a 20 percent stake in the airline's share capital. In addition, silent deposits totaling up to EUR 5.7 billion and a loan of up to EUR 3 billion are planned. However, the latter is not subject to the requirements and was basically approved in March. Aid is needed for Lufthansa because the corona pandemic has brought the company's business, with the exception of freight, to a standstill with the following travel restrictions. As a result, tens of thousands of jobs are on the brink in the group with around 138,000 employees. The worldwide headcount has recently been put at 22,000. Around 11,000 of these are in Germany. At an extraordinary general meeting this Thursday, Lufthansa shareholders should decide whether they want the state to invest as a shareholder or not for around 300 million euros. Indirectly, they are also judging the entire bailout package of nine billion euros: If state entry into the share capital fails, the rest of the bailout package consisting of silent participation and a KfW loan will lapse. Now that the largest Lufthansa shareholder, the billionaire and industrialist Heinz Hermann Thiele has announced his approval, green light is expected. Thiele holds around 15 percent of Lufthansa shares and has a blocking minority in the decision due to the already established low participation of less than 38 percent of the voting rights. He had previously criticized the package. He considered the planned state influence too great, the price for the participation too high and the exit scenario almost impossible to fulfill. Green economic politician Katharina Dröge sharply criticized Thiele's approach. \"I found it absolutely incomprehensible and irresponsible what Mr. Thiele was doing. For me it looked like a blackmail attempt to put the group's bankruptcy in the room, so that we could put pressure on and renegotiate,\" said Dröge on Deutschlandfunk. But it was a good signal that he was initially unsuccessful. The state is a better entrepreneur than Thiele. The main shareholder had speculated regardless of the 138,000 employees. \"The state would do it differently.\" Meanwhile, on Thursday night, the company and the UFO union agreed on a crisis package for flight attendants with savings of more than half a billion euros. According to UFO, the package includes four-year protection against dismissal and savings of over half a billion euros by the end of 2023. Lufthansa announced that, among other things, increases in remuneration would be suspended and contributions to company pensions temporarily reduced. Savings contributions should also be decided with the ground staff. Negotiations with the Ver.di union were sluggish, said Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr at the annual general meeting. While talks were good with the pilots and an agreement had already been reached with the UFO cabin union, negotiations with Verdi were \"disappointing,\" said Spohr. Great progress would have to be made quickly if the excess staff on the ground did not result in redundancies. According to the union, the talks should continue on Friday.\n",

            " The Council of Experts for the Assessment of Macroeconomic Development Expects an Economic Slump of 6.5 Percent This Year. \"The corona pandemic is expected to cause the biggest slump in the German economy since the existence of the Federal Republic,\" said Lars Feld, chairman of the so-called economic policies. In the global economic and financial crisis in 2009, German GDP fell by 5.7 percent. However, a gradual recovery is likely to start in the summer, so that the economy will grow by 4.9 percent again from 2021. At the end of March, the Council of Experts assumed the most likely scenario was that there would be a five-week lockdown and then the restrictions for companies and consumers would be relaxed again. In this case, the committee assumed that the German gross domestic product (GDP) would shrink by 2.8 percent in the current year. In the worst case, the \"economic practices\" assumed a minus of 5.4 percent. But things got worse than expected: industrial production dropped to its lowest level in over 20 years, and the export industry experienced a historic crisis in the spring. Domestic tourism came to an almost complete standstill at times, and the hospitality industry is struggling to survive, according to the industry association Dehoga. A number of economists anticipate a significant increase in bankruptcies for the year as a whole. The Chairman of the Expert Council, Lars Feld, had already announced a revision of the forecast at the end of May. \"The lockdown took longer and the foreign trade is hit harder than expected. We were clearly too optimistic, especially with regard to the United States,\" said the Freiburg economics professor recently. Like other experts, the economies assume that Europe's largest economy will grow again next year after the severe recession. The Expert Council forecasts 4.9 percent growth for 2021. At the earliest in 2022, Germany's economic output is likely to return to the level it had before the pandemic.\n",

            " Ron Jeremy, an American porn actor, has been charged with rape in Los Angeles. Prosecutors list four women, including rape and sexual assault, in the published charges against the 67-year-old. The attacks against women aged 25 to 46 are said to have occurred in a house and bar in West Hollywood between 2014 and 2019. Jeremy faces 90 years in prison if convicted. Jeremy was taken into police custody. His bail was set at $ 6.6 million. His lawyer Stuart Goldfarb denied the allegations. Jeremy was not a \"rapist,\" Goldfarb told AFP. Over the past few years, Jeremy has faced allegations of sexual assault, including colleagues from the sex film industry. But the porn star always denied the descriptions of the women. Jeremy, real name Ronald Jeremy Hyatt, is one of the iconic characters in the porn industry. He has starred in more than a thousand sex films. In 2007 he published an autobiography entitled \"One man and four thousand women\". In it he described himself as sex-obsessed. The wave of allegations of violence and assault against celebrities in the entertainment industry had started with the fall of Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein. The allegations against Weinstein became known in autumn 2017 triggered the worldwide #MeToo movement against sexual violence against women. The sensational lawsuit against Weinstein was primarily about two allegations: Weinstein is said to have forced production assistant Mimi Haleyi to have oral sex in 2006 and to have raped today's hairdresser Jessica Mann in 2013. In February Weinstein in New York was found guilty of rape and sexual assault and sentenced to 23 years in prison in March. He is currently serving this sentence in a New York state prison.\n",

            " A bankruptcy among the Dax groups: This has never been the case at Deutsche Börse since the leading index was introduced 32 years ago. But Dax investors will probably have to live with the insolvent Wirecard for a while. Only when the stock market indices are regularly checked on September 3 does the crashed payment service provider from Aschheim near Munich drop out of the index - because of its bankruptcy, but also because of the plummeted stock market value. On Thursday, Wirecard was only worth around EUR 350 million on the stock exchange - almost two billion years ago, it was almost EUR 25 billion. However, the rules and regulations of the stock exchange do not provide for an earlier farewell or ejection of the share. \"Deutsche Börse consistently implements the existing rules and regulations,\" said a spokesman. An individual case regulation is not possible. After all, market participants need to know what to expect. A change of the rules is possible, \"also against the background of the dynamics of the past weeks and months. Events of individual Dax values ​​are also considered in our considerations,\" said the spokesman. After all, the stock market indices are supposed to reflect economic reality - those who invest in the Dax want to buy the most important German companies. However, important market participants would have to be asked before a change - and this may take time. The stock exchange even prepared for the event of bankruptcy: But on page 42 of an 88-page guide, it is expressly stated that companies who have filed for bankruptcy will only be removed from the index at the next review date - in this case, in September. An immediate exclusion would then only be possible if the bankruptcy was rejected due to lack of assets or the company was liquidated - but neither is to be expected until then. Membership in the strictly regulated Prime Standard of Deutsche Börse is a prerequisite for a place in the Dax. But Wirecard could only vacate the space there voluntarily - which insolvency administrators often cause in the course of the procedure to save money. But even that would not accelerate the Dax farewell: According to the stock exchange regulations, the termination only takes effect after three months. The fact that Wirecard did not present its annual report for the past year - due to a lack of attestation - and that it will not be able to do in the insolvency for the foreseeable future either has no consequences for Dax membership: \"Violations of the post-admission obligations have no direct impact on the Membership in a Dax index, \"said a spokesman for the exchange. An exclusion from the Prime Standard is only possible if a company \"repeats, ie over several years, does not submit its annual financial statements\".\n",

            " For women, having children means accepting significantly less income. The so-called living income of women with a child is on average a good 40 percent lower than that of childless women, according to a study by the Bertelsmann Stiftung. The authors of the study see a \"double inequality\" for mothers given the general income gap between men and women. If a woman has three or more children, the average income gap compared to childless women is almost 70 percent, according to the study. For men, on the other hand, children do not mean a loss of income; depending on their age, fathers even earn significantly more than men without children. According to the study, the main reason for the inequality is that \"in fact, the model of the male breadwinner\" or the woman as a mere additional earner still dominates in Germany. Although \"women are in no way inferior to men in terms of their qualifications for the job market\", they are more often only part-time or not at all and at the same time primarily responsible for the household and the care of children or relatives - regardless of their age. According to the study, only childless women with an expected income of 1.3 million euros will approach the income of men of the same age in their working life. The study looked at the year of birth 1982 in West Germany as an example. On the other hand, mothers of the same age with one child earn 43 percent less - a second child increases the gap to 54 percent and a third to 68 percent. An earlier study commissioned by the Bertelsmann Stiftung showed in spring that men earn almost twice as much money as women than at work. West German men therefore have an average total income of 1.5 million euros between the ages of 20 and 60, while West German women only have 830,000 euros. In the east, men earn 1.1 million euros during this period, women earn 660,000 euros. The study authors expect the corona crisis to further increase inequality. \"Possible countermeasures range from a better work-life balance, a reform of spouse splitting and mini-job regulations, and better wages,\" they wrote. They also spoke in favor of more collective agreements for the occupations classified as systemically important.\n",

This was announced by the district administrator of the Gütersloh district, Sven-Georg Adenauer. A total of 3127 findings were available. We still have a chance to prevent a regional lockdown, \"said Adenauer.\" We have no significant entry of corona cases into the general population. \"The corona screening on the meat factory premises in Rheda-Wiedenbrück in North Rhine-Westphalia has continued Bundeswehr soldiers have been supporting the measures since Friday. Adenauer said the current situation was an \"absolute exception\" for the administration, which is why the city also asked for help from the Bundeswehr and the state According to Adenauer, the top priority of the Gütersloh district was to \"contain the spread and prevent a shutdown. In addition, the personnel data of all employees was obtained late Friday evening.\" The company had not managed to give us all the addresses to deliver, \"said Adenauer.\" It was really an effort, \"he said. Now would be mobile e teams visiting around 1,300 addresses in the Gütersloh district. Adenauer said that housing conditions would be examined, cutbacks made and quarantine measures provided. In this context, crisis chief Thomas Kuhlbusch sends clear words to Tönnies: \"The trust that we put in Tönnies is zero,\" he said. \"We got address lists, there were thirty percent of the employees without an address. At some point, people say that they leave work. We were at the Tönnies company last night at 9:00 p.m. and finished by 1:30 a.m. last night. Then we had the complete address lists. \" He was happy that the dark field of staff accommodation could be brightened. It was announced on Wednesday that an outbreak with a large number of people infected with corona had occurred among the employees of the largest German slaughterhouse in Tönnies near Rheda-Wiedenbrück. A corona outbreak had already occurred in May at a Westfleisch slaughterhouse in the Coesfeld district. The district had ordered on Friday that all around 7,000 Tönnies employees at the Rheda-Wiedenbrück location together with all household members had to be in quarantine. This also affected the administration, management and the top management, said the district of Gütersloh on Friday evening. For some employees, however, there was a so-called work quarantine. That means that they can move between work and place of residence - exclusively. According to a group spokesman, this also applies to the shareholder Clemens Tönnies. The country wants to consistently enforce the quarantine order for employees. Armin Laschet (CDU), Prime Minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, said on Friday evening in Düsseldorf that he would use all the means at his disposal. \"We have to make sure that everyone follows the rules in this situation.\" There has never been a corona outbreak \"this size\" in NRW.\n",

            " Apple announced iOS 14 on Monday evening with an elaborate video show. The software will drastically change the look of Apple smartphones and offer them a number of new functions, including use as a car key. The most important innovations at a glance: A new app library should automatically sort apps so that you don't lose track of many installed apps. Pages can be hidden at the touch of a finger and a new alphabetical overview should make it easier to find apps. Widgets can now have different sizes and are dragged from the widget screen (swipe once from the start screen to the left) onto the start screen, i.e. between the apps. While working with other apps, Siri can be given tasks that are then processed via the active app. If you want to add something to your shopping list with web browsers, you can request this by voice command and the list will appear briefly above the active app. After Google and Microsoft, Apple is also introducing a translation app that can mediate between eleven languages, including German. Because the app works offline, protection of personal data is guaranteed. The chat app is expanded to include options to respond directly to individual statements in group chats or to address responses to individual conversation participants. The Apple Maps map app is expanded to include the option of calculating bike routes. For the time being, however, this will only work really well in a few cities. In addition, routes for electric cars can be calculated so that you are automatically directed to charging stations in good time. With iOS 14, the iPhone can be used as a car key - but only for the new BMW 5 Series. One of the advantages of this technology: You can give your car key to other users on a temporary basis without giving it up. App clips are something like mini-apps that you can load onto your cell phone by scanning a QR code or holding the cell phone to an NFC transmitter. For example, cafes and restaurants can bring their offer including payment function, but without an app download, to their iPhone in seconds. An option that was not mentioned, but appeared on a screenshot: In the future, iPhone users can determine which email app and which browser they want to use. There is no longer any need to specify Apple's apps. In addition, iPadOS 14 was shown in the evening, which should have the following features in addition to the innovations announced for iOS 14: A new side toolbar, which summarizes all important commands in the Photos app, for example. The search function has been completely revised so that it is better to search for files and Apps can search. In the future, calls will be announced through a discreet window. Handwritten entries can be automatically converted into text. New software called scribble also helps improve drawings by correcting geometric shapes and straightening lines. Public beta versions of iOS 14 and iPadOS 14 should be made available in July. The final versions should appear in autumn and run on iPhones from the 6s model and iPads from the iPad Air 2.

            " 7000 people are already isolated, daycare centers and schools are closed: After the Corona outbreak in Rheda-Wiedenbrück in North Rhine-Westphalia, the authorities are looking for the causes. The virus outbreak at the meat company Tönnies could have mainly occurred in the cutting area, the hygiene expert Martin Exner from the University of Bonn now suspects after a tour of the factory. \"There people stand on assembly lines and have to do heavy physical work with knives,\" Exner said on Wednesday afternoon in the Gütersloh district house. \"In addition, the room air must be constantly cooled down to eight to ten degrees to reduce the number of germs.\" The problem: The room air in the cutting room is constantly chased through the cooling system to keep the temperatures low. Infectious aerosols and suspended particles circulated in the air instead of falling to the ground. \"The aerosols are also not filtered in the cooling system and are constantly being whirled through the room,\" said Exner. As soon as there is a sick employee, the likelihood of infection is particularly high. Usually, the microparticles sink to the bottom or are blocked by breathing masks within a certain period of time. \"But with this heavy work, masks are extremely tiring for the employees and can lead to shortness of breath,\" says Exner. Circulating air circulation is not only available at Tönnies. According to the hygiene expert, a solution would also have to be found for all other companies with cooling systems or outdated air conditioning systems. \"So far there are no regulations because we have to learn something new every day with this new pathogen,\" said Exner. That is why Tönnies is only partially to blame in the cutting rooms. He did not want to comment on the conditions in the housing complexes of the workers at Tönnies; In order to solve the circulating air problem, mobile devices with high-performance filters would have to be purchased urgently. \"Surgeons are already using such germ filters in operating rooms to keep the risk of infection low,\" says Exner. However, new filter systems specifically for the corona virus would now have to be found. In addition, the hygiene expert pointed out that workers in companies such as Tönnies need special masks that allow physical work. \"The masks should be safe, but still allow an easier air supply.\" According to the Gütersloh district administrator Sven-Georg Adenauer, the first corona tests gave hope to the population: 230 of the 600 current smears are currently available, 229 of which are negative, and one result is still open. \"It's a very small glimmer of hope,\" says Adenauer.\n",

            " Cathy Hummels has again won a trial in alleged surreptitious advertising. The influencer and wife of soccer star Mats Hummels also won her lawsuit in second instance. The Munich Higher Regional Court (OLG) rejected an appeal by the Social Competition Association on Thursday. The organization accuses the 32-year-old and other influencers of surreptitious surreptitious advertising on the Instagram photo portal, where she has almost 530,000 followers. According to Hummels, she received no consideration from the companies concerned for the criticized contributions. \"I'm doing this free of charge because that's my passion,\" she said on the sidelines of the trial. After the verdict, she was pleased that \"the new world will be treated the same way as the old world\". Before the Munich I regional court, the presiding judge had compared Hummels' Instagram profile to a women's magazine. \"Print media do nothing else,\" she said. Informed internet users would know that Hummels pursued commercial interests with her Instagram profile. In this respect, it is also not unfair advertising. Hummels took it up gratefully at the time: \"My account is just like a women's magazine with all its facets.\" It is unclear whether the litigation with the judgment is actually off the table.

            " According to the Reuters news agency, the federal government has agreed on a training bonus of up to EUR 3,000 in order to avoid a drop in in-company training as a result of the corona crisis. The key points drawn up by the Ministry of Education, Economy and Labor are to be decided on Wednesday by the cabinet, as Reuters learned from government circles. The Federal Government plans to provide a total of 500 million euros for this and the coming year for the \"Secure training places\" program. The centerpiece is a bonus of 2,000 or 3,000 euros for small and medium-sized companies that are \"significantly affected\" by the crisis and still train. For this alone, up to 280 million euros are estimated in the key points. The training bonus is intended to be given to companies with up to 249 employees who have been severely affected by the crisis but who, however, have not reduced the number of apprentices compared to the average of the past three years. You will receive a grant of 2,000 euros for each apprenticeship contract concluded for the 2020 training year. If they increase their training, there should be 3000 euros for each additional apprenticeship. A company is particularly affected in which there was at least one month of short-time work in the first half of the year and or in April and May sales fell by at least 60 percent compared to the same months in the previous year. According to Reuters, \"training institutions in the health and social professions\" were also included in the key points. In addition to the training bonus, the cornerstones also provide help if short-time work for apprentices is avoided or if trainees are taken over from insolvent companies. Compared to the same period in the previous year, significantly fewer apprenticeship contracts have been concluded for the training year beginning in autumn. In the craft sector alone, the number of apprenticeship contracts agreed between January and May is a good 18 percent below the previous year's figure. \"This is not only due to the economically tense situation of the companies, but also to a large extent to the uncertainty among many young people as to whether training is taking place at all,\" said craft president Hans Peter Wollseifer. Almost 33,000 craft apprenticeships are not yet available.\n",

The undoped Grimme Online Award is the most important German award for outstanding online journalism and has been awarded since 2001. The jury announced that terms such as herd immunity, number of reproductions and seasonality had also made it into general use through the podcast. The podcast demonstrates that even extensive science journalism can captivate the audience. The format also opened up new audience groups for the medium podcast. The podcast, which is currently in the summer break, also won a vote by Internet users on all the nominees. The video \"The Destruction of the CDU\" by YouTuber Rezo won an award in the \"Special\" category. Rezo had previously won the Nannen Prize. Rezo had criticized, among other things, the CDU's climate policy in the video. It also sparked a debate about the role of social media in forming and dealing with parties. Two awards went to the public service content network Funk. On the one hand, the jury praised the investigative video report format \"STRG_F\", which, among other things, caused a sensation with fake allegations against the moderators Joko and Klaas. The second radio format with the Grimme Online Award 2020 was the \"Karakaya Talk\" - a web talk show with Esra Karakaya, which provides a forum for people with a migration background. Other prizes went to the NSU-Watch weblog, which once documented the NSU process. Since then, the journalists and scientists have continued to research, including on the right-wing scene as a whole. The \"RomArchive\" was awarded to a project that deals extensively with the cultures of the Sinti and Roma.\n",

            " The price drop of the Wirecard share is unprecedented in German stock market history. The Dax group lost more than 80 percent of its market value within 25 hours. The company from Aschheim near Munich has long been Germany's greatest tech hope. The gigantic drop in prices should not encourage German savers to invest their money in stocks. One or the other will be right to ask what the situation is in the financial sector when a company sinking into chaos is one of the 30 most important German stock exchange companies. \"The Causa Wirecard could cement Germans' distrust of the capital market,\" my colleagues write in the current SPIEGEL editorial. The damage that Wirecard is doing to the equity culture is already immense. In fact, the debacle impressively reminds every shareholder: Those who invest their money in individual companies are exposed to an enormous risk and can destroy most of their capital within hours. There have been massive doubts about Wirecard for a long time because the group is suspected of messing up its balance sheets and pretending deals and business partners. But unforeseen slumps also occur to a certain extent in traditional companies: just think of the diesel scandal at Volkswagen, the crash of Lufthansa shares in the wake of the corona crisis, or years of mismanagement at the steel giant Thyssenkrupp. Henning Jauernig, 28 years old, has been fascinated by the stock exchange since childhood. He bought his first own share when he was 20, and the first fund shares followed a few years later. Since then he has been in charge of his finances. His friends keep pestering him with financial questions: How can I invest my money correctly? What insurance do I need? And how do I make my tax? He writes about answers to all of these questions on the Young Money blog. It is wrong to conclude that stocks are generally not suitable for old-age provision. Despite all the interim corporate crises, it remains the same: If you want to achieve a return on your savings in times of ultra-low interest rates, there is no getting around stocks. Experience shows that, despite all crises, it is generally worthwhile to invest in stocks on a permanent basis. Almost all economists and financial experts agree on this. Nevertheless, it is a bitter realization of the Wirecard debacle that German investors are paying particular attention to the local capital market in their investment strategy. Various studies show that the Germans, if they invest in stocks at all, are more likely to invest their money in stocks from their homeland. Scientists call this phenomenon \"home bias\", which also occurs in other countries. The Wirecard case now shows again that this is a mistake. Because even investors who have invested in the leading German index Dax are suffering from the Wirecard price slump. Price inquiry time 06/26/2020 03:38 AM No guarantee The top German stock exchange league has not been on the descending path since the Wirecard scandal. Apart from the software company SAP, the most important German stock market barometer consists mainly of weakening industrial stocks and stale financial companies. Investors who use the Dax as a base investment miss out on a lot of returns. The barometer has been lagging behind its US counterparts for years. There are also exciting German companies, but they are often not listed on the stock exchange. On the other hand, anyone who relies on the world stock index MSCI World, which comprises around 1650 stocks from 23 industrialized countries, benefits from the development of the global economy and thus, for example, from the enormous price increase of the US tech companies. The index is also much more suitable for small savers because it spreads the money invested more widely. With several hundred shares, it is not so bad if one or two crashes. Wirecard, for example, weighed just 0.03 percent on this index on Wednesday. Critics complain that US stocks have a very large weight in the MSCI index, so it is riskier than is commonly claimed. The relatively new FTSE All World, which includes 3900 positions from almost 50 countries, is therefore an alternative. Beginners only need to buy so-called index funds (ETFs) that faithfully replicate these stock indices at affordable costs (read how to do this here). Such ETFs are of course not completely safe, investors bear the so-called market risk. In the wake of the corona crisis, ETFs on the MSCI World also plummeted before the prices recovered. The trick is to simply sit out such crises: Between 1975 and the end of 2019, ETFs that track this world stock index achieved an average return of 9.14 percent per year - including serious crises such as the Lehman crash of 2008. When asked about these figures by investment advisors in banks, they often counter that human fund managers could protect investors from losses because they can switch bad stocks for good ones during downturns or reduce the number of securities in the fund overall, while a large stock market index Takes rashes up and down fully. But the Wirecard case shows that the fund managers mostly fail to manage this. Union Investment, the fund service provider of the Volks- und Raiffeisenbanken, and the Deutsche Bank subsidiary DWS have long relied heavily on the Wirecard share in some of their funds, which are sold to German small savers a million times. The bet backfired.\n",

            " A New York police officer apparently used an illegal stranglehold on the arrest of an African American, has been suspended. Police chief Dermot Shea said in a tweet about a \"disturbing\" incident. The investigation is still ongoing. The police released a body cam video, and there were cell phone recordings of a passerby. The videos seem to show that the policeman choked a man lying on the floor. The city of New York passed a law last week prohibiting and criminalizing the use of strangleholders.

            " The 35-year-old African American was injured and taken to hospital in the Queens District arrest on Sunday morning (local time), the New York Times reported. Several police officers were present in the incident. One of the reasons for the access was suspected of disturbing the peace. Since the death of African-American George Floyd in a brutal police operation in Minneapolis on May 25, mass protests against racism and police brutality have occurred nationwide. Cities and counties have announced police reforms, such as the abolition of controversial practices such as strangleholds. Floyd had died after a white police officer pushed his knee down the 46-year-old's neck for minutes.\n",

            " Potsdam's climate researcher and director of the Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change (MCC), Ottmar Edenhofer, warns of a comeback of fossil fuels in the wake of the corona recession. \"There is a great danger that many governments will switch back to coal electricity to revive the economy,\" he told SPIEGEL. The background is an MCC study, according to which there are still too many coal-fired power plants in operation worldwide. After that, almost twice as many power plants were built or planned in the past five years as were put back in the same period. Forever vacation Because of regular operation: Why the school chaos continues If the rest of it remains, the current and future power plant park alone will emit around 86 percent of the CO2 emissions that are permitted under the Paris climate agreement. In addition, the current economic downturn gives coal-fired power plants an additional advantage. According to the study, building a new building is still cheaper in many regions than building a corresponding number of wind or solar parks.\n",

            " Actress Megan Fox has described Hollywood as a \"brutally misogynistic\" industry. In a post on Instagram, the 34-year-old responded to a discussion that had arisen on the internet in relation to an old interview with her. In 2009 she reported to Jimmy Kimmel how she had to dance under a waterfall as a minor for Bad Boys 2 in a bikini. The video spread again in the past few days, fans criticized that Fox had been mistreated and sexualized as a young Hollywood actress. Michael Bay directed \"Bad Boys 2\", as did years later \"Transformers\" - the film that made Megan Fox world famous. And in which there are also sexualized scenes, such as those in which Fox inspects the engine compartment of a stuttering car. Fox now emphasized that she was pleased with the support from the fans, but had to clarify details regarding the two examples, otherwise they would throw an unnecessarily bad light on the wrong places. At this point you will find an external content from Instagram that complements the article. You can show it with a click and hide it again.\n",

            " It is true that she had to audition when casting for \"Transformers\" on the director's private Ferrari. But she was of legal age at the time and did not have to undress either. \"As for this particular casting story, I was not a minor at the time, and I was not forced to 'wash' someone's cars or work on them in a way that was not related to the material in the actual script had to do, \"she wrote. Fox has already spoken about \"Bad Boys\" in several interviews. She really thanks for the support. \"But these specific cases were irrelevant on a long and arduous journey in which I had some really harrowing experiences in a brutally misogynistic industry.\" She gave no other examples. Regarding \"Michael\" and \"Steven\", presumably referring to \"Transformers\" producer Steven Spielberg, Fox wrote that she had never been sexually molested. There are \"many other names that deserve to go viral at the moment\". But these are \"safely stored in the fragmented remains of my heart\". It has been known for years that the cooperation between Fox and the \"Transformers\" makers did not end peacefully. According to Michael Bay, Spielberg recommended that he fire the actress for her abuse. Co-star Shia LaBoeuf, on the other hand, had previously said that the director felt Fox was too pushed into the sex corner.\n",

              "TextBlob(\"A thick cloud of Sahara sand has reached the Caribbean and is now moving towards the US coast, reports the US Weather Service. Measured by its size and concentration of dust, it is the largest cloud of its kind in half a century. The phenomenon is therefore known as the \"Godzilla\" cloud. Because of the dust particles, the air quality has already reached values ​​in some regions of the Caribbean from which experts assume a possible health hazard. People in affected regions are encouraged to stay indoors and use air filters if they have them. At nine million square kilometers, the Sahara is the largest dry desert on earth - and the largest source of dust on our planet. Every year, around 500 million tons of it fly from there to different parts of the world, sometimes thousands of kilometers away, including Germany. San Juan: The visibility at the airport was less than eight kilometers. It is normal for dust clouds to form over the Sahara at this time of year, which are carried westwards by winds. The extremely dry and dusty air moves across the North Atlantic approximately every three to five days from late spring to autumn, reports the U.S. Climate Change Agency. Dust transport across the Atlantic plays an important role for ecosystems. For example, sandstorms from the Sahara in the Amazon region fertilize the rainforest. In the Caribbean, almost the entire upper layer of the earth comes from Africa. During the summer months, the Sahara clouds move towards the Caribbean, in winter to the Amazon region. This time, however, the dust cloud is exceptionally large. Satellite images from NASA show how the cloud has spread since mid-June. In the meantime, it stretched more than 3,200 kilometers from the west coast of Africa to the edge of the Lesser Antilles in the western North Atlantic. The visibility at the airport of San Juan, the capital of Puerto Rico, was just eight kilometers. \"This is the most significant event in the past 50 years,\" said environmental scientist Pablo Méndez Lázaro from the University of Puerto Rico. Meanwhile, the cloud is moving toward the southeast coast of the United States.\")"
